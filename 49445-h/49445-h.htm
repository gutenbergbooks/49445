<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap14 p2">ALTHOUGH strictly speaking the term “Mechanics”
applies to that branch of Physics that deals
with the actions of forces on material bodies, originally
the word had a broader meaning embracing all
machinery and mechanical inventions. To-day popular
usage is restoring to the term its original broad
interpretation, and it is in this popular but rather
unorthodox sense that “Mechanics” has been chosen
as the title of this book; for although certain elementary
principles of mechanics are described and
explained, the major portion of the book deals with
machines and their evolution to their present stage
of perfection.</p>

<p>Machines are man’s creation, and yet in a sense the
man of to-day is a machine product; for modern
civilization owes its material and in large measure
its esthetic development to machinery. The story
of machinery, from primitive man’s first attempts
to augment his physical powers with mechanical
aids down to the present era of gigantic, steel-muscled
machinery and marvelously intricate mechanisms,
is the story of human progress. It is this
story that we have endeavored to tell in the following
pages, but the subject is too large to be covered
in a single volume or even a dozen volumes. Under
the circumstances we have been obliged to confine
ourselves to a mere outline, selecting certain avenues
of progress more marked than others and presenting
brief sketch maps of them. We have aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in this way to give a bird’s-eye view of the whole
story of human progress in things material.</p>

<p>The book has not been written for the mechanical
engineer, but for the layman who would learn of
the mechanical contrivances that contribute to his
material welfare; hence technical terms have been
avoided, as far as possible, and where unavoidable
have been explained and defined.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">TOOL-MAKING ANIMALS</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHEN we review the marvelous achievements
of modern civilization we are quite willing to
agree with the ancient psalmist that man is “little
lower than the angels.” But at the other end of the
scale our complacency is liable to receive a rude
shock; apparently the boundary between man and
beast is not so very easy to draw.</p>

<p>We used to be told that one important superiority
of mankind lies in the fact that he makes use of
tools, while the beast never uses any implement except
those that nature has furnished him as part of
his own organism. But a gorilla will throw stones
at his enemy; and he knows how to brandish a club
and use it with telling force. Some of the apes are
known to use sticks to knock down fruit which is
out of the reach of their hands, and they will crack
nuts with a stone. Clearly these animals are tool
users. A very intelligent orang-utan in the Bronx
Zoölogical Garden, New York, after trying for days
to wrench off a bracket from the wall of his cage
eventually used the horizontal bar of his trapeze as
a lever and with it pried the offending bracket from
its fastenings. Here was real invention and the
discovery of the principle of leverage. The great
black arara cockatoo of New Guinea uses his
beak as a saw to weaken the shells of hard nuts,
and to keep his bill from slipping off the smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shell he is ingenious enough to wrap a leaf around
the nut to hold it steady.</p>

<p>Even in the insect world we find creatures resourceful
enough to make use of tools. Prof. Franz
Doflein of the University of Breslau tells of an interesting
study of certain ants, known as the <i>Oecophylla
smaragdina</i>, who build their nests in bushes
by fastening leaves together with fine threads. But
the ants that build the nests cannot spin these
threads, because they possess no spinning glands.
They must depend upon their larvæ for this product.
When a rent was made in one of these nests, a band
of the tiny creatures ranged themselves side by side
along the torn edge of the leaf and reached across
the gap until they could catch hold of the opposite
edge with their mandibles. Then they drew back
step by step, with perfect teamwork, until the two
edges were brought together. In the meantime,
other ants had rushed to the nursery and each one
had picked up a larva, not with the idea of bearing it
off to safety, but in order that the babies might spin
the thread which the adult ants were unable to do.
The larvæ were carried to the breach in the nest and
moved back and forth across the rent. They were
pressed first against one side of the tear and then
the other and all the while were squeezed tightly,
evidently with the purpose of making them spin.
Gradually a fine silky web was woven across the torn
leaf and eventually the rent was completely patched.</p>

<p>Unquestionably these little ants are tool-using animals,
because they make their larvæ serve as spinning
spindles and also as weavers’ shuttles. However,
this can hardly be cited as a point in common
with even the lowest type of man, for the ants
merely use the tools they find at their disposal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
They certainly cannot be credited with having produced
or even improved the tool which they use,
whereas even in the most primitive of men we find
that the tools used are not only carefully selected
for the work to be performed, but are actually,
shaped, be it ever so crudely, to suit the job.</p>

<p>Clearly we must shift the boundary between man
and beast, distinguishing the former as the creature
who artificially improves his tools. But even here
it is not absolutely certain that the boundary will
stand. Wilhelm Boelsche, a well-known German
writer on natural history, calls attention to the
“blacksmith woodpecker” which will thrust hard
pine nuts into cracks in the trunk of a tree, so that
they are held as if in a vise, enabling the bird to
operate upon the seed more easily. Furthermore,
this woodpecker will actually make a hole in the tree
to receive the nut if there is not a hole or crack
handy, so that evidently this animal does produce or
artificially improve the tool that it uses.</p>

<p>There are a few such examples in nature, just
enough to cast a bit of uncertainty on the boundary
we have set. But although the actual line of demarcation
may not be clear, there is no question but
that the lowest type of humanity now existent, or
of which we have any record, is or was a tool maker.
Chipped stones evidently fashioned by man for some
useful purpose are found even in the remains of the
Middle Tertiary Epoch. The spirit of inquiry, of
experiment, of invention, and the ambition to dominate
over other members of the animal kingdom or
over the obstacles imposed by nature, are to be found
more or less active among all peoples, no matter
how lowly a position they may occupy in the scale
of civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h3>WAR AS A STIMULUS OF INVENTION</h3>

<p>The most primitive implements were probably
developed for the purpose of war. From the very
earliest times, down to the present day, war has been
a most potent stimulus of invention. The first tools
ever used were probably intended to enable the user
to cope with dangerous enemies. They marked the
first stage in the conquest of brain over mere brawn.
The primitive weapons were used not only in fighting
other men, but in fighting off dangerous animals,
and then in hunting animals for food. No doubt
the first implement ever used was a club, which gave
a real advantage over the unarmed, scratching, tearing,
and biting enemy. This was a lever which increased
the reach of the fighter, and also increased
the power of his blow. The heavier the club, the
more dangerous the weapon, particularly when most
of the weight was centered at the outer end of the
stick. But he was a real genius who first fastened
a rock to the end of his club.</p>

<h3>THE ART OF BREAKING STONES</h3>

<p>Then arose the art of breaking stones&mdash;breaking
them skillfully, so as to form a jagged cutting edge.
When man began to fashion tools of stone he left
imperishable records of his craftsmanship which enable
us to trace his progress in invention. The first
finished tool we find was the fist hatchet&mdash;a stone
roughly chipped to form a cutting edge and of convenient
shape for the grasp of the hand. This primitive
tool very slowly, through a period covering
thousands of years, developed into all manner of cutting
implements, some with handles of wood and
bone. The ax head was followed by the spearhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and this finally by the arrowhead, showing that man
had at last found a mechanical substitute for his
muscles to hurl projectiles farther and with greater
accuracy than he could throw them by hand.</p>

<p>We marvel at the resourcefulness and skill of the
primitive savage in working so difficult a material
as stone. It would baffle a modern mechanic to be
required to shape a piece of flint into an arrowhead
with no other tool than a piece of bone. He is
so accustomed to using tools which are harder than
the material they are intended to shape that he cannot
conceive of making any impression upon a piece
of flint with a piece of bone, to say nothing of a stick
of hard wood, and yet such tools were used away
back in the Stone Age. At first stones were roughly
shaped by hammering them together. Then the
artisans became more skilled. They discovered that
certain stones could be chipped more regularly and
evenly, and the art of flaking off chips of flint sprang
up. Some specimens that belonged to ages long preceding
that of recorded history are beautifully done.
The spearheads are symmetrically shaped like a long
narrow leaf, and the stone is evenly furrowed on
both sides with a keen edge all around.</p>

<p>Not only did primitive artisans shape the stone
implements with hammer blows, but they learned
how to shape stone by pressure as well, using a tool
that was relatively soft. It is not a very difficult matter
to shape even so hard a substance as glass merely
by pressure. If a piece of glass is laid on a table
with its edge slightly overhanging that of the table,
it is possible to chip off the overhanging edge by
pressing a nail or even a hard stick of wood against
this edge. A small flake of glass is thus removed,
and, by continuing the process, arrowheads of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shape may be formed. The tool is placed not against
the upper surface of the glass, but against the edge
of the glass, so that only the lower surface of it is
split or flaked off. Then the glass is turned over and
a chip is taken off the opposite face.</p>

<p>In the Middle Stone Age we find the primitive
craftsman equipped with a very complete assortment
of stone tools. He had hammers, chisels,
scrapers, drills, and polishing tools. He knew how
to make useful household implements, such as spoons
and ladles, out of bone. He polished his work and
ornamented the implements with carvings of animals.
Ivory pins and needles show that he had begun
to make himself clothing from the skins of animals
and that he sewed them together with thongs
or tendons.</p>

<p>In the Late Stone Age he had learned how to make
vessels of fire-baked clay. His axes were ground to
a sharp edge, and he bored holes in the ax head to
receive the ax handle. The Swiss lake dwellers built
houses of wood and fitted them with all sorts of
wooden furniture carved with stone tools. Among
the remains of these interesting settlements may be
found balls of clay which, from the fact that one of
them was discovered with a spool of flax still attached
to it, were evidently used as spinning
“whorls” used for spinning flax into thread. Clothing
of skins was giving way to or being supplemented
with clothing of woven fabric.</p>

<h3>DISCOVERY OF THE LEVER AND THE WEDGE</h3>

<p>Prior to the Stone Age the club was undoubtedly
used, in time of peace&mdash;if there ever was a time of
peace in those days&mdash;to batter down trees, to beat
through entanglements and to dislodge great stones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Here the first idea of leverage was evidently employed.
The club with a rock tied to it, particularly
if the rock was shaped with a sharp edge, made a
better implement for hewing trees. It is quite probable
that soon after this stage of development had
been reached, some one discovered the use of the
wedge, particularly in splitting timber. Of course,
no one realized in those early days why it was that
he could pry up a greater weight with a lever than
he could lift directly by hand, or why he could split
open a log by driving wedges into it. The <i>art</i> of
mechanics was in existence long ages before <i>science</i>
of mechanics began to be studied. But it was not
until men began to look into the why of things that
rapid progress was made.</p>

<p>We can go on endlessly with our speculations on
the evolution of tools and machinery up to the time
when historians began to record the mechanical
achievements of man. Unfortunately even after
historians began to write they were so filled with
admiration for the destructive work of man that
they had no time to record his constructive work.
The warrior who spread havoc and terror received
all the glory, and his deeds were written on parchment,
inscribed in clay and carved in stone; but the
humble artisan was not worthy of mention. Even
when the science of mechanics came to be studied,
it was shrouded in a veil of mystery, and it was beneath
the dignity of the man of science to impart
his knowledge to the artisan. There was a lack of
cooperation between science and industry that has
persisted to a certain extent even up to the present
time. Some of the most ingenious inventions of the
ancients were employed by a corrupt and crafty
priesthood to produce apparently miraculous effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and hoodwink the general public; and so, in looking
back to the early days of mechanics, we are obliged
to draw upon our imagination to trace its evolution,
supplementing this by a study of the tools of primitive
people of more recent time. Practically every
form of hand tool we now use must have been known
to the ancient artisan.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE WHEEL</h3>

<p>We are not going to attempt to write a history of
the evolution of machinery, but there is one invention
whose origin is lost in the remote prehistoric
ages which deserves more than passing attention.
It is a pity that we have no clue as to who invented
the wheel or how this most important element that
enters into the construction of nearly all machinery
was evolved. The invention called for a remarkable
degree of originality. There is nothing like a wheel
in nature. Levers we have in our own physical
frame. But a wheel is something that is distinctly
a human creation. Whoever invented it must have
been a real genius, a James Watt or a Thomas
Edison of his day. Certainly we owe more to the
invention of the wheel than we do even to so revolutionary
a machine as the steam engine, or the flying
machine. How it was ever first conceived is a mystery.
Maybe this primeval genius got his idea from
seeing a stone rolling downhill, or he may have
seen a tumbling weed rolling along the ground before
the wind. It may be that the forerunner of the
wheel was a roller shaped out of a log, for certainly
primitive civilization must have advanced enough to
have known how to hew timber before it would have
been capable of fashioning a wheel. Some observant
man might have noticed that he could drag a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
timber over a rolling log much more easily than he
could along the bare ground, and gradually the roller
evolved into a wheel.</p>

<p>We can speculate upon the evolution of vehicles
and transportation, once the wheel was invented.
Of course, the first method of transporting loads was
to carry them in the arms. Possibly loads were
placed on skids and dragged along by one end.
Away back in early times, it was discovered that
two persons could carry more than twice as much as
one, if the load were placed on a couple of poles.
There was no friction to contend with, and not only
was the load cut in two, because each man bore half
of it, but the position of the load was such that it
could be borne more easily. After the wheel was
discovered, some one must have conceived of the idea
of dispensing with an assistant by placing a wheel
between the poles of the stretcher, thus making a
crude wheelbarrow. It is more likely that two
wheels were first used, making a cart of the
stretcher, because the crude workmen of those days
could hardly have produced anything but a very
wobbly wheelbarrow. At any rate, the wheel, or pair
of wheels, robbed one man of his job. Only one bearer
was required where before two had been used. Labor
costs were immediately reduced 50 per cent.</p>

<h3>DISPLACING MEN WITH MACHINES</h3>

<p>In the very earliest days of invention machines
began to displace men. Had there been unions in
those days, no doubt there would have been strenuous
opposition to the introduction of this substitute
for an honest worker. But among the ancients,
even more than at the present time, invention meant
greater production rather than less work, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the laborer of that time was not a hired man but a
slave. There was no object in cutting down labor
when it cost practically nothing. The only stimulus
to invention was greater production.</p>

<p>The invention of the wheel meant the dawn of
transportation, which is the backbone of civilization,
and from it resulted no end of other inventions. It
made it possible for communities to come into closer
touch with each other. It meant circulation&mdash;an
interchange of knowledge and of products. Food
was transported from one locality to another, enabling
certain communities to dispense with agricultural
work and specialize in certain lines of
manufacture; for they could barter their products
for food raised by other communities. There are
some tribes to-day which are most backward because
they are separated from other tribes by rivers, while
other tribes similarly placed owe their progress to
the fact that they have developed sufficient skill to
build crude bridges and thus gain access to the outside
world.</p>

<h3>RAISING WATER</h3>

<p>In Egypt the wheel had a wonderful effect on
agriculture. In that dry land water is, and always
has been, most precious. No wonder the Nile was
venerated! It meant life&mdash;life to crops, and hence
life to man. How to raise water from this stream
of life in time of drought was the great problem of
the Egyptian. As slave labor was cheap, it was customary
to haul up the precious water, a bucket at a
time, and pour it over the fields. Then some one discovered
that this process could be simplified by using
a <i>shadoof</i> or swape; in other words, a long pole fulcrumed
near one end, with a heavy rock for a counterbalance
lashed to the shorter arm, and a bucket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tied by a long rope to the longer arm of the lever.
This primitive machine is still to be found in some
rural districts. With this contrivance, a heavier
load could be lifted than by hand, because, when
raising the bucket, the weight of the rock would
assist in lifting the water. After the swape came
all manner of ingenious devices for lifting the water.
There were seesaw arrangements which would scoop
up some of the water at each oscillation of the seesaw,
and in one ingenious contrivance there was a
succession of seesaws by which the water was raised
to a considerable height, whence it poured down into
ditches that irrigated the fields.</p>

<p>Then some one invented a water wheel or a great
wheel, fitted with buckets, which was turned by human
or ox power, and which poured a steady stream
of water into the irrigating ditches.</p>

<p>But the greatest invention was that of the engineer
who actually made the river turn the wheel.
It was probably on the Nile that the <i>noria</i>, as this
machine was called, was first put into service.</p>

<p>The wheel was provided with paddles, so that the
current made it revolve, and the water spilled out of
the buckets into a trough as they were turned over
by the wheel. We can imagine the triumph of the
ancient inventor who developed that machine. True,
the river might arise in its wrath now and then and
wreck the machine, but in wrecking the wheel it had
to flood the land, which, after all, was exactly what
was aimed at. The anger of the river was short-lived;
it soon quieted down and went on placidly
turning the wheel which robbed it of the precious
water. It was a great event in the history of engineering.
The Nile had been harnessed. One of the
great powers of nature had been set to work.</p>

<p class="pch">THE ANATOMY OF A MACHINE</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">EVERY animal is a complex machine, provided
with its own motive power and a brain for directing
the operation of its own mechanical elements.
Not satisfied with the mechanism that nature has
put into the human machine, man has reached for
other elements and devised mechanisms of his own
in order to supplement the human machine and increase
its efficiency. At first, as we have seen, these
elements were hand tools of the crudest sort; but
they were gradually improved and then they were
combined into what we term machines. In developing
these machines, he naturally took his own system
as a pattern and was guided to a large extent by an
examination of his own physical structure. We see
this very clearly in the names of the different parts
of machinery, which are taken from the names of
similar parts in the human frame. Almost every
member of the body is used in mechanical terminology.
For instance, we have the “head” and the
“foot,” the “arms” and the “legs,” the “fingers” and
the “ankles,” “elbows,” “shoulders,” “trunk,” “hips,”
and various parts of the face, such as the “eyes,”
“ears,” “nose,” “mouth,” “teeth,” “lips,” and even
the “gums,” to indicate parts of machinery which
have some remote resemblance to these features.</p>

<p>Before we can understand machinery we must
have some general knowledge of the elements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which it is composed. Probably most of the readers
of this book already possess a fair knowledge of
machine elements and mechanical movements and
they can well afford to skip this chapter. However,
for the benefit of the uninitiated, we must put a
machine on the operating table, dissect it, and explain
its anatomical structure. We cannot attempt
a very detailed study, but will confine ourselves to
the most important elements.</p>

<p>Every machine is made up of movable parts and
fixed parts, the latter serving to guide or constrain
the motion of the former; for no combination of
elements will constitute a machine unless the parts
are <i>constrained</i> to move in certain predetermined
directions.</p>

<h3>THE LEVER</h3>

<p>Among the moving elements the first to be considered
is the lever, which really forms a broad
classification comprising many elements that will
hardly be recognized as levers at first blush. Levers
in some form are to be found in practically every
machine. A wheel, a gear, and a pulley are really
levers in disguise, as will be explained presently.</p>

<p>Of course everyone knows that a simple lever
consists of a rigid bar that swings on a fulcrum.
The fulcrum may be a knife edge, a shaft passing
through the bar or any element on which the bar
can be swung or oscillated. The purpose of the
lever is to give a certain advantage in the application
of a force to a load. This may be a change of
speed and distance of travel, and hence of power,
or merely a change of direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-028.jpg" width="450" height="366"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 1.&mdash;THREE ORDERS OF SIMPLE LEVERS</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are three types or <i>orders</i> of levers produced
by varying the relative positions of the points where
the fulcrum, the force or effort, and the weight or
load are applied. These are shown in Figure 1.
In the lever of the <i>first order</i> the fulcrum is placed
between the effort and the weight; in the lever of
the <i>second order</i> the weight is applied between the
fulcrum and the effort; and in the lever of the <i>third
order</i> the effort is applied between the fulcrum and
the weight. In each case that part of the lever
which extends from the fulcrum to the point where
the effort is applied is called the <i>effort arm</i>, and that
which extends from the fulcrum to the point where
the weight is supported is the <i>weight arm</i>. The
weight that can be lifted with a given effort depends
upon the ratio of the effort arm to the weight arm.
If the two arms are of equal length, the effort is
equal to the weight, but twice the weight can be
lifted with the same effort if the effort arm is twice
as long as the weight arm. You can lift a ton with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
an effort of only 100 pounds if your effort arm is
twenty times as long as your weight arm but the
end of your effort arm would have to move twenty
inches to raise the ton weight one inch. We are assuming
in all these cases that the lever itself has no
weight and that there is no friction at the fulcrum.</p>

<p>Of course levers are not used merely for the purpose
of lifting weight, but to overcome any resistance
or merely to apply pressure upon an object.
In almost every household we may find examples of
the three orders of levers. A pair of shears, for instance,
is composed of two levers of the first order,
swinging on a common fulcrum. The effort is applied
at the handles, and the weight or load is the
material that is cut by the blades or, speaking more
technically, the handles are the <i>effort arms</i> and the
blades are the <i>weight arms</i>. A material that is too
tough to be cut at the tip ends of the blades may be
easily cut if we move it in near the fulcrum or pin
that hinges the blades together; for by doing this we
shorten the weight arms, because the weight arm is
measured not to the end of the blade, but to the point
where it is cutting into the material. To cut very
tough material, such as heavy tin or sheet steel, we
use long-handled short-bladed shears. The cutting
pressure depends upon the ratio of the effort arm to
the weight arm. If the effort arms are twice as long
as the weight arms, the cutting pressure is twice as
great as that applied at the handles.</p>

<p>A nutcracker consists of a pair of levers of the
second order. The fulcrum is at one end and the
effort or pressure is applied at the opposite end of
the levers or handles, while the equivalent of the
weight (in this case the nut) is placed between the
effort and the fulcrum. Again the <i>effort arm</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
measured from the fulcrum or hinge pin of the tool
to the point where the hand pressure is applied, and
the weight arm is measured from the fulcrum to
the nut. The effort arm may be four or five times
as long as the weight arm, so that the pressure exerted
on the nut is four or five times as great as that
exerted by the hand on the ends of the handles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-030.jpg" width="400" height="288"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 2.&mdash;AN ANGULAR OR BELL-CRANK LEVER</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the case of a pair of sugar tongs we have another
tool something like the nutcracker in construction,
but here the weight, i.e., the lump of sugar, is
seized by the ends of the tongs while the hand pressure
is applied somewhere between the fulcrum and
the weight. Hence we have here a lever or pair of
levers of the third order. The <i>effort arm</i> of a pair
of tongs is always shorter than the <i>weight arm</i> and
the pressure on the sugar lump is always less than
that exerted on the tongs by the hand. Evidently
the most powerful tool of the three is the nutcracker,
because the effort arms extend over the full length of
the tool and are always longer than the weight arms.</p>

<p>A lever need not consist of a straight bar; the
effort arm may form an angle with the weight arm,
forming what is known as an angular or bell-crank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
lever (Figure 2). When a common claw hammer is
used to pull out a nail, the claws that slip under the
head of the nail form the weight arm and the hammer
handle the effort arm. A horizontal pull on the
handle produces a vertical lift on the nail.</p>

<p>Sometimes two or more levers are interconnected,
as in Figure 3, the effort arm of one being linked to
the weight arm of the other. This serves to increase
the lifting force at the weight and at the same time
keep the mechanism within compact limits. Such
compounding can go on indefinitely and is subject to
all sorts of variations.</p>

</div></div>

<p>One thing we must not forget, and it is a matter
that is commonly overlooked by perpetual motion
cranks, namely, that while a pound of pressure on
the effort arm may be made to lift two, four, or a
hundred times as many pounds on the weight arm
by varying the relative length of these arms, it has
to move two, four, or a hundred times as far as the
weight arm, so that the work done on one side of
the fulcrum is always exactly equal to that done
on the other side.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 4.&mdash;PRIMITIVE GEAR WHEELS&mdash;TWO
COACTING GROUPS OF LEVERS</p>
</div></div>

<p>If we take a number of levers radiating from a
common fulcrum like the spokes of a carriage wheel,
we have a primitive gear wheel. Two such groups
of levers may be mounted on parallel shafts so that
when one is turned its spokes will successively engage
the spokes of the other group and make the
latter turn (see Figure 4). Each spoke is first an
effort arm on one side of the wheel and then a weight
arm as it turns around to the other side of the wheel,
and as the effort arms and weight arms are of the
same length there is no multiplication of power. A
pound on one side of the wheel cannot lift more than
a pound on the other. The driven wheel receives
the same power as the driving wheel except for such
loss as may be due to friction at the bearings or
where the spokes contact. The only advantage of
such a pair of gears is that the direction of rotation
of the driven wheel is the reverse of that of the driving
wheel. If the spokes of one wheel are longer
than those of the other, we have at once a variation
in the rate of rotation proportional to the relative
diameters of the two wheels. In Figure 5, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the diameter of the driving wheel A is twice
the diameter of the driven gear B, and so, for each
revolution of A, B must make two revolutions, i.e.,
the driver must make two revolutions for each
revolution of the driven wheel. In other words,
the speed of revolution is doubled. However, if we
make B the driver the speed of the driven wheel A
will be half of that of wheel B.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 5.&mdash;COACTING LEVERS OF UNEQUAL LENGTH</p>
</div></div>

<p class="b2">In primitive machines spoke gears were seldom
mounted on parallel shafts because of the difficulty
of keeping the spokes in alignment. Instead, one
shaft was mounted at right angles to the other so
that one set of spokes would cross the other (Figure
6), thus producing the equivalent of a bevel gear.
This was of advantage in changing the plane of rotation.
A later development was the <i>barrel</i> or <i>lantern
gear</i>, which permitted transfer of power without
changing the plane of rotation. A cylindrical bundle
of rods constituted one of the wheels (as shown in
Figure 7). Instead of being crudely formed of
spokes, the other wheel sometimes consisted of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
disk with pins radiating from its rim. Such
gears in far more refined form are still used
in modern clocks and watches. A still further development
for transmitting motion to a plane at
right angles to that of the driving shaft is
shown in Figure 8. Here we have a <i>crown</i> gear
in which the pins instead of radiating from the
periphery of the disk project from the side face
of the gear.</p>

<p>Turning back to our first spoked wheels, it is very
evident that we may put a rim over the spokes or
even fill in between the spokes and convert the
wheels into solid disks that are in frictional engagement
with each other without getting away from
the fact that we are dealing with levers. Each wheel,
then, consists of a continuous revolving lever. Friction
gears are used quite commonly in machinery
when it is desirable to have the wheels slip if subjected
to excessive strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h3>TOOTHED GEARS</h3>

<p>By forming teeth on one gear to mesh between
similar teeth on the other, we convert the friction
gears into a pair of spur gears (Figure 9). We need
not go into the intricacies of the form of gear teeth.
They are designed to be in continuous rolling contact
while they are in mesh. The novice is apt to
call all spur gears “cogwheels” and gear-teeth “cogs.”
Mechanics, however, recognize a difference between
cog wheels and spur wheels. In the former, the
teeth, or cogs, are not cast upon or cut out of the
wheel body, but are separate pieces fitted to the
wheel. Such wheels are found in old water mills.
They consist of wooden wheels with iron or steel
teeth mortised in the wooden rim of the wheel. In
general it is safer to speak of spur gears because
there are few cogwheels now in use.</p>

<p>When a small gear engages a large one, the former

</div></div>

<p>If two friction wheels are to turn at right angles
one to the other, they must have conical bearing surfaces,
as in Figure 10. The angle between the shafts
of the two gears and the relative size of the gears
may be changed as desired, provided each cone surface
has its apex at the intersection of the two shafts
or axes. It is easy to understand how such conical
friction gears may be converted into toothed bevel
gears (Figure 11), by forming teeth on the conical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
surfaces, and it will be evident that the teeth must
taper toward the apex of the two cones. Two bevel
gears of equal diameter, and with shafts set at right
angles one to the other, are known as <i>miter</i> gears.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 11.&mdash;TOOTHED BEVEL GEARS</p>
</div></div>

<p>So far we have not shown any combination of
gearing that will multiply power. In Figure 5, the
driver A is twice the diameter of the driven wheel
B, and the latter makes two revolutions for one of
A, but the speed at the periphery of the two wheels
is the same. A pull of one pound at the point <i>a</i> produces
a pressure of one pound at <i>b</i>, and this in turn
produces a lift of one pound at <i>c</i> because the levers
in each wheel are perfectly balanced, that is, each
lever has equal effort and weight arms. The way
to obtain an increase of power and of peripheral
speed is to fasten two wheels of unequal diameters
together on the same center and apply the effort to
one of the wheels (as in Figure 12) and the weight
to the other wheel. This gives us what is technically
known as a <i>wheel and axle</i>. The dotted lines show
that we have here a lever of the first order which can
be used to multiply power in the same way that a
bar lever does. If one wheel is twice the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the other then a pound of effort will lift two
pounds of weight.</p>

be shifted about in such fashion as to give us a
lever of the second and one of the third order. The
power may be enormously increased and the speed
of the final wheel greatly reduced by setting up a
train of gears in which the effort is received by the
larger one of each couple and is delivered by the
smaller one. In Figure 14 the smaller wheels are
half the diameter of the larger ones. A pound of
pressure at A will amount to 2 at B, 4 at C, 8 at D,
16 at E, and 32 at F. On the other hand, point A
will have to move through 32 inches to make the
point F move an inch.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc250">FIG. 16.&mdash;TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT OF BLOCK AND TACKLE</p>
</div></div>

<p>A pulley is merely a modification of the wheel.
Figure 15 shows how it may be arranged to correspond
to the three orders of simple levers. If the
pulley axis is fixed, as in the first order, the effort
and weight arms are equal and hence balanced. In
the second order the wheel is bodily movable, hence
one pound will raise two pounds of weight because
the power arm is twice as long as the weight arm,
while in the third order it takes two pounds of lift
to raise one pound of weight. There is no end of
possible combinations of pulleys which will multiply
power in the same way that bar levers do when compounded.
A common arrangement of block and
tackle is given in Figure 16. There is a four-sheave
pulley block above and a three-sheave block below,
but in order to trace the rope clearly the pulley
wheels or sheaves are represented as of different
diameters. The arrangement consists of a series of
levers of the first order in the upper pulley block
coupled to a series of levers of the second order in
the lower block. To find the weight that a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
power will lift, multiply the effort by the number of
strands of rope that are supporting the weight. In
this case there are seven such strands, not counting
the strand E, to which the effort or pull is applied.
This means that a pull of a hundred pounds at E
will lift 700 pounds at W. Of course a pull of seven
feet at E will raise the weight only one foot.</p>

</div></div>

<h3>THE INCLINED PLANE AND ITS FAMILY</h3>

<p>The inclined plane constitutes a second broad classification
of machine elements. The wedge, the screw,
the cam, and the eccentric, all belong to the family
of the inclined plane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-044.jpg" width="400" height="281"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 18.&mdash;INCLINED PLANE WITH EFFORT
PARALLEL TO THE BASE</p>
</div></div>

<p>A simple form of inclined plane is pictured in Figure
17, which shows a weight W being rolled up an
incline. The effort required to carry it to the top of
the incline depends, of course, upon the steepness of
the incline. The drawing shows a rise of 3 feet on
a slope 5 feet long, and the weight of the wheel is,
say 20 pounds. To find the effort required, the
weight is multiplied by the rise (20 × 3 = 60) and
divided by the length of the slope (60/5 = 12) and
we find that it takes only 12 pounds to roll the 20-pound
wheel to the top of the incline. This holds
true when the pull is parallel to the inclined face.
If the pull is parallel to the base of the incline, as
in Figure 18, we must divide by the length of the
base instead of the length of the incline (60/4 = 15)
and we find that it takes 15 pounds of effort to pull
the weight up the incline. If the pull is exerted at
an angle both to the base and the inclined face, we
have a problem that is slightly more complicated
and we need not go into it here because it involves
a bit of trigonometry. In all cases, however, it may
be noted that the amount of rope that is taken in,
in hauling the weight up the incline, bears a definite
relation to the amount of effort required to raise the
weight. In Figure 17, 5 feet of rope must be pulled
in, in order to raise the weight 3 feet, so that
⅗ of 20 or 12 pounds is all that is required to pull
up the weight, while in Figure 18, 4 feet of rope is
hauled in for a lift of 3 feet, so that ¾ of 20 or 15
pounds is required to pull up the weight. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
respect the inclined plane is exactly like the lever or
the pulley, for the <i>effort</i> multiplied by the <i>distance</i>
through which it is exerted is always exactly equal
to the <i>weight</i> multiplied by the <i>distance</i> through
which it moves. Thus in Figure 17, the effort 12
pounds multiplied by the distance 5 = the weight 20
pounds times the distance 3, and in Figure 18, effort
15 x distance 4 = weight 20 x distance 3. Of course,
we are ignoring the weight of the rope and the friction
which, in actual practice, are important factors
to be reckoned with.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 19.&mdash;ENDLESS SCREW OR
WORM GEAR</p>
</div></div>

<p>So far we have considered a fixed inclined plane,
but when the inclined plane is moved between the
weight and a fixed base it is known as a wedge, and
in this case, too, the effort required to move the
wedge multiplied by the distance the wedge moves is
equal to the weight multiplied by the distance it is
lifted.</p>

<p>The commonest form of inclined plane is the screw
which is merely an inclined plane bent around a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cylinder. A screw engaging a toothed wheel, as in
Figure 19, gives a combination known as an “endless
screw,” or, more commonly, as a worm gear. The
screw or worm is always the driver, and as it must
make a complete turn to move the gear through a
space of one tooth, the power of this combination is
very great. It is practically impossible to turn the
worm by using the gear wheel as a driver because
the friction developed at the point where the worm
and gear contact is very great. For this reason
worm gearing is used in the steering gear of automobiles.
The shaft of the steering wheel is fitted
with a worm which meshes with a worm gear on the
parts connected with the wheels. It is very easy to
turn the wheels by operating the steering wheel, but
if the wheels strike a rut or a stone they are not
deflected from their course, because the worm makes
it impossible for them to turn the steering wheel.</p>

<p>The spiral gear shown in Figure 20 is a cross between
a worm gear and spur gear. The teeth are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
spirals set at an angle of 45 degrees to the axis of
the wheel. In this case either gear can be used to
drive the other, and the advantage of such a pair is
that power is transmitted from one shaft to another
in a different plane and at right angles to the first.</p>

<p>Cams are usually irregular revolving inclined
planes. Figure 21, shows a cylinder or drum cam.
A groove is cut in the cylindrical wall of the cam
and an arm or lever is provided with a roller which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rolls in the groove. When the cam is revolved the
lever is constrained to follow all the twists and
turns of the groove. A different form of cam is
shown in Figure 22. It is formed with an irregular
periphery against which the roller is pressed by a
spring. As the cam wheel revolves, the roller and
the arm to which it is attached must move in and
out over all the hills and valleys of the periphery.
The cam is one of the most useful elements in modern
machinery, for it provides a very simple means
of producing the most complicated and irregular
motions.</p>

<p>We cannot attempt to describe all the different
types of cams, but reference should be made to the
eccentric, which is a form of cam commonly used to
operate the valves of a steam engine. The cam in
this case is a perfectly circular disk, but the shaft
that turns it does not lie at the center of the disk,
consequently an object bearing against the periphery
must move toward and away from the center as the
disk revolves. Instead of using a spring-pressed
roller to bear against one side of the disk, the whole
disk is encircled with a ring of steel known as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

and as the eccentric revolves the strap makes the
valve rod move back and forth. (See Figure 23.)</p>

<p class="pch">MACHINES FOR MAKING MACHINES</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">WHILE we may glory in the wonderful mechanical
progress of to-day, we must not overlook
the marvelous skill of the ancient artisan nor forget
that it is to his inventive genius that we are indebted
for practically every hand tool we possess.
Only a few special tools owe their origin to the modern
inventor. All the rest date back beyond the twilight
of history. We have merely improved upon
these tools by slight changes of design or the employment
of better materials in their construction.</p>

<p>As users of these tools we cannot begin to compare
with the skilled workman of ancient days. Our
progress is shown not in the <i>development</i> of skill,
but in the <i>loss</i> of it. We have taken the tool out of
the human hand and put it into an inanimate machine.
It is only very recently that the tool was
delivered to the machine and that act marked the
dawn of the present remarkable mechanical era.</p>

<p>Machines for making machines date back to the
time of the early Egyptians. They had their pole
lathes and bow drills, but these machines only partially
relieved the workman of his labors, and the
quality of the work still depended upon a degree of
skill that was acquired only through years of patient
apprenticeship.</p>

<p>The pole lathe, by the way, consisted merely of a
pair of centers between which the work was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
mounted, a pole attached to the ceiling and a strap
or rope passed around the work and fastened at one
end to a pole and at the other to a pedal resting
against the floor. (See Figure 24.) When the pedal
was depressed, the strap was pulled down and the
work was revolved. On releasing the pedal, the
spring of the pole pulled the strap up and reversed
the rotation of the work. Thus by alternately depressing
and releasing the pedal, the work was
intermittently revolved against a chisel which was
rested on a block and guided by the workman. Small
work could be turned out on such a lathe with considerable
precision, but when it came to large parts,
particularly parts of steel, the workman was easily
tired by the effort of operating the pedal and was
apt to be irregular in the guiding of the tool.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 24.&mdash;PRIMITIVE POLE LATHE</p>
</div></div>

<p>Up to the middle of the eighteenth century practically
no advance had been made over the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lathe of the Egyptians, and when, 150 years ago,
the steam engine was invented the task of building
the engine seemed almost insuperable.</p>

<p>James Watt was a maker of mathematical instruments,
a man of great skill and precision as a craftsman,
but he dealt with parts of small dimensions.
When he conceived of his steam engine, he mentally
pictured the various parts as turned out with all the
accuracy and finish that was possible in the diminutive
members of a scientific instrument. To him it
seemed perfectly feasible to turn a cylinder which
would be practically perfect in contour, and to fit
it with a piston around which no steam could leak.
With the lathe then in existence such a fit was easily
possible on small work. But when he undertook to
have the cylinder of his engine bored, he discovered
that there was no machine that could begin to do
the work properly. In fact, when Smeaton, who was
a prominent engineer of that time, investigated
Watt’s steam engine, he declared that it was such a
complicated piece of work that neither tools nor
workmen existed that could build it. In Watt’s first
engine, the cylinder was only six inches in diameter
and two feet long, and a special type of boring machine
was devised to bore the forged cylinders. But
the boring was so irregular that when the piston was
inserted and the steam was turned on, nothing would
stop the flow of steam that leaked around the piston.
In vain did James Watt use cork, oiled rags, tow,
paper, and even old hats to stop the leakage. However,
the boring machine was improved and later a
cylinder, eighteen inches in diameter, was bored
with such accuracy that the large diameter exceeded
the small diameter in the worst place by only ⅜
of an inch. This Watt considered a very good bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of turning. To-day cylinders of that size that vary
from true by half the thickness of the paper
that this is printed on would be thrown out as defective.</p>

<p>It was in 1769 that Watt invented the steam engine,
but that great event did not mark the dawn of
the present era of machinery. For a quarter of a
century thereafter there was little progress in the
development of machine tools. A boring machine
was built that did fair work. There were a few sawmills
in which wind power was employed to drive the
saw. But lathes were still driven by foot power and
the cutting tool was still held and guided by hand.</p>


<h3>MAUDSLEY’S “GO-CART”</h3>

<p>The real father of the present era was a very
clever British mechanical engineer, Henry Maudsley,
who undertook to eliminate the uncertainties of the
human hand by clamping the cutting tool of the
lathe in a rest and arranging the rest to slide along
the length of the lathe or transversely toward or
away from the center. These two motions made it
possible to accomplish all that the workman could
accomplish by hand and at the same time the tool
was held so firmly that accuracy and precision of
turning was assured. Furthermore, he provided this
slide rest with a nut that engaged a screw driven
through suitable gearing by the lathe spindle. Then,
as the work revolved, the slide rest was compelled to
move along the bed of the lathe at a uniform rate.
By varying the gearing, the speed of the slide rest
and the tool it carried could be varied at will, thus
making it possible to cut screw threads of any pitch
desired with a degree of accuracy unattainable by
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Remarkable as was this improvement, it met with
the usual opposition that every real advance in
machinery received in those days. People referred
to the slide rest as Maudsley’s “go-cart,” but it
proved such an important element of the lathe and
so very valuable that before long it was universally
adopted. From that time on the skill of the workman
began to lose its importance. The man began
to give way to the machine. Precision was possible
in large as well as small work. The human element
was also dispensed with in the driving of the lathe.
The foot pedal was superseded by the steam engine,
and the machine came to be known as the engine
lathe.</p>

<p>There are many ways of working metals now in
common use. Metals may be cast in a molten state,
or they may be pressed and molded into shape in a
cold state, or they may be hammered either cold or
hot, but in nearly all cases in which metal is removed
in order to form a piece of work, the chisel
is used as a cutting instrument. This is perfectly
apparent in lathes and planers, but not quite so apparent
in sawing, drilling, filing, and grinding. A
drill is merely a spiral chisel which revolves upon
its own center. A saw is a gang of tiny chisels, and
a file consists of still smaller chisels which are
broader than those of the saw. In grinding we have
rough surfaces in which particles of emery or carborundum
act as tiny chisels. The shears, the punch,
and the cutting torch are practically the only exceptions
to the rule that metals are always cut by chisels,
and even the shears may be conceived as consisting
of a pair of broad coacting chisels, while it takes little
imagination to see a form of chisel in the punch.
The cutting torch is, of course, in no sense a chisel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>In the cutting of metals the work may move
against a fixed tool or the tool may move against a
fixed piece of work. In a lathe, it is the work that
revolves or rotates against the tool. In the drill and
the milling machine the tool revolves against the
work.</p>

<p>In the planer, the tool is fixed and the work slides
against it. The shaper reverses the operation; the
work is fixed and the tool moves in a rectilinear
direction.</p>

<p>Up to the nineteenth century practically the only
machines for cutting metals were the lathe and a
crude form of boring machine. The machinists of
that day had not reached the stage where they were
able to produce anything but round work on a
machine. The planer had not been born. It was for
this reason that Watt had a great deal of difficulty
in getting rectilinear motion for the piston of his
engine. He had to invent a complicated system of
links and levers in order to obtain a practically
parallel motion to guide his piston in and out of the
cylinder. When the planer was invented and it was
possible to produce straight surfaces with a considerable
degree of accuracy, all of Watt’s ingenious
parallel motions, went into the discard and the
cross-head and guides took their place.</p>

<p>It was not until long after the planer had been invented
that Eli Whitney, the American genius of cotton-gin
fame, conceived the milling machine. He
reversed the operation of the lathe by placing the
cutting tool on the revolving spindle and sliding the
work against it. Milling cutters consist of wheels
formed with a number of cutting edges or chisels
which are arranged either on the periphery of the
wheel or on the face of the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the milling machine, came the grinder,
in which a revolving wheel of an abrasive material
served to wear away the surface of a piece of work,
and with this form of machine steels of great hardness
could be finished with accuracy and a high polish.</p>

<h3>THE INTERCHANGEABLE SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The most notable advance in machine work came
early in the nineteenth century, when what was
known as the “American System” of manufacture,
or the interchangeable system, was introduced. As
long as mechanics were obliged to perform their
operations largely by hand, it was impossible to attain
great accuracy. Each workman put his own
individuality into the work. As a consequence, no
two pieces were of exactly the same size or shape.
This was true even with the early power-driven
machine tools. The parts might be very close to the
same size, but careful measurements showed that
they varied by a minute fraction of an inch. Hence,
when a machine was assembled the unyielding metal
parts had to be filed and trimmed and hammered to
fit them together. If any accident occurred to a
machine, the damaged part could not be replaced by
another taken from stock. The entire machine had
to go back to the shop where an experienced
mechanic would make a new part to replace the
damaged one. In those days a machine was not
manufactured but was built as an individual
mechanism, just as a house or a boat is built to-day.</p>

<p>With the advent of accurate machine tools came
the idea of standardizing the parts so that hundreds
and thousands of pieces could be made of exactly
the same dimensions, and in assembling a machine
the parts could be picked at random from the stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and put together without the use of special tools
and without requiring any special fitting. This
was of special importance in the tools of warfare,
because armies need quantity production, i. e.,
rifles, cannon, etc. More machines of the same kind
were required for an army than for any other organization
or line of work. At the close of the
Napoleonic War the British Government had 200,000
parts of muskets either partly finished or waiting
repairs. Their muskets were made after the
old system. Each one was built separately with
its parts individually fitted together, so that whenever
any part was injured, the musket had to be
laid aside and sent back to the workshop for repairs.</p>

<p>Long before that time, the idea of making standard
guns had been hit upon in France. Thomas
Jefferson, while Minister to France, in 1785, wrote
of the French system which was then being developed
by a mechanic named Le Blanc. He was building
a musket in which the parts were of standard
pattern, and which could be assembled by taking
pieces haphazard as they came to hand and putting
them together without special fitting. Thomas
Jefferson called the attention of the American Government
to this system and showed that it was
possible to produce muskets cheaper by that method
of manufacture. However, our Government at that
time failed to avail itself of the opportunity of
utilizing this system of manufacture.</p>

<p>Later on, the idea was taken up in this country
by Eli Whitney and by Simeon North. When Whitney
attempted to introduce the system, he was
laughed at by French and English ordnance officials,
and even our own Government officials were
skeptical, particularly when they found that it required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
so much preparation in the way of machinery
and designing of parts before a single musket
was completed. It seemed like a waste of money
to invest in so much preparation. But Whitney was
soon able to silence all his critics by taking to Washington
ten pieces of each part of a musket and then
selecting at hazard from each pile of pieces the
requisite parts and putting together ten muskets.
It was not long before the foreign governments
saw the importance of this method of manufacture.
Great Britain later adopted it in the making
of her own rifles and called the process the
“American System.”</p>

<p>But it was not only in the field of rifles that interchangeable
manufacture made itself felt. The New England
clock industry provides an interesting
illustration. At first the clocks were made of wood,
but early in the nineteenth century, a clock maker,
Chauncey Jerome by name, designed a brass clock
in which the parts were made on the interchangeable
system. Instead of building each clock as a
separate piece of work, clocks were turned out by
the thousands, and at an extremely low price. Soon
he had flooded this country with his clocks and began
to look around for other markets. Machinery
had been used by other clock makers in producing
wooden clocks, and movements which had cost
$50 each in 1840 had been reduced to $5. But
Chauncey Jerome’s clock was made of brass and by
means of the interchangeable system of manufacture
he could produce it for less than 50 cents. The
clock was such a success in this country that Jerome
decided to try it abroad. Consequently he made arrangements
with an agent in England and shipped
over a large consignment. The British Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was astonished at the low price of the clock and was
convinced that it had been undervalued. At that
time, they had a simple and ingenious method of
punishing a consigner who undervalued the goods
he wished to introduce into the country. This consisted
in promptly appropriating the property at the
price given in the invoice. In due course of time,
much to Jerome’s astonishment, he received a letter
from the British Government stating that his clocks
had been confiscated, and with the letter came a
check paying for them at the invoice price. Jerome
was not in the least dejected by the rebuke; on the
contrary, he was rather elated, for, as far as he could
figure it out, he had a spot-cash buyer for his goods
and no selling expenses. He did not mind at all
letting the British Government have the clocks at
the invoice price. So he decided to try again with
a larger shipment. To his great delight this shipment
met the same fate as the first, and in due
course another good British check arrived. Thus encouraged,
Jerome sent over a third and still larger
shipment, but by that time Johnny Bull began to
suspect that the Yankee clock maker was getting
the best of the bargain and, finally convinced that
clocks really could be produced with profit at the
low invoice price, he permitted them to enter his
country. With this striking example, the fame of
the Yankee system of manufacture spread over the
world.</p>

<p>In order to have two parts alike, they must be
placed under a machine in exactly the same way. In
other words, they must be set in “jigs” or frames
which are fitted into the machine in such a way that
the tools will approach the work from exactly the
same angle or penetrate the work to exactly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
same depth in ten, or a hundred, or a thousand, or a
million pieces, as the case may be. Making jigs and
dies consumes a great deal of time in preparation
work, but once the preparation stage has been
passed, articles are produced with wonderful rapidity
and very little waste of time. Formerly it was
necessary to determine the location of each hole in
a casting separately and spend precious time in adjusting
the work to the proper position under the
tool. If the hole was to be threaded, it had to pass
through several separate operations.</p>

<h3>THE TURRET LATHE</h3>

<p>After the slide rest invented by Maudsley, the
next great improvement on the lathe was a turret
head or a sort of turntable which carried a number
of tools. The tools are arranged to come automatically
into play one after the other. One tool,
for instance, may cut a groove in the work, another
finish the face of the work, another bore a hole
in the piece and another tap the hole. In many
cases, several of these operations are performed
simultaneously. The head of the lathe is provided
with a hollow spindle so that the work is automatically
fed to the tools through this spindle, and
as soon as one piece is finished, it is automatically
cut off and the jaws of the clutch which holds the
work, or stock as it is called, open automatically so
that a new length may slide forward and be operated
upon by the tools. The machine requires no
attention once the tools have been set up to the
proper angle, except that it must be kept supplied
with bars of stock as they are consumed, and with
a copious flow of lubricant on the tools. One operator
can therefore take charge of a number of automatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lathes. All he does is to feed them; they do
the rest.</p>

<p>The modern drill has also gone through a great
many developments in order to speed up the work
that it performs. When a casting is to have forty
or fifty holes drilled and tapped in it, instead of following
the old method of drilling each hole separately,
a lot of separate drilling spindles are used,
each fitted with a drill, and these are brought simultaneously
into play. As many as fifty or sixty holes
may be drilled at a single operation, and after the
holes have been drilled, the drilling spindles move to
one side to make way for the taps, which thread
such of the holes as are to receive screws. By first
setting the spindles in the proper position and then
using jigs to locate the work properly under them,
the assurance is had that every one of the scores of
holes drilled will be accurately spaced apart and the
spacing in every casting will be identical.</p>

<p>The multiple tool system is also used in milling
machines in which a number of milling cutters
either of the face or the end type come into play
simultaneously upon a piece of work set in a suitable
jig, and cut the piece with absolute precision,
so that all castings will have faces accurately spaced
apart and cut to exactly the same level.</p>

<p>It is by such methods as these that we are able to
produce such large quantities of machinery at remarkably
low cost. One of the most notable
examples of such work was the development of the
Liberty engine during the World War. This engine
did not differ in principle from others built in
Europe or in this country, but its design was carefully
adapted to permit of interchangeable manufacture.
No careful finish was used except where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
indispensable. Special jigs, tools, and fixtures were
prepared. Ingenious wrinkles of American manufacture
were introduced. All this consumed time,
and great was the irritation of the general public.
Under ordinary conditions, it would have taken
years to have developed the Liberty engine to the
manufacturing stage, but under the urgent stress of
war, the whole work of design and preparation for
manufacture was crowded into a few short months,
and then Liberty engines began to be manufactured
on a stupendous scale.</p>

<h3>CUTTING WITH RED-HOT TOOLS</h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable advances in machine
tools was due to the studies of Fred W. Taylor. He
entered a large steel plant in 1880 and was immediately
struck with the enormous waste of effort
on the part of the men in the plant. There was
at that time considerable dissatisfaction among the
workmen, and when Taylor endeavored to speed up
work he was faced by the incontrovertible argument
that he had no idea how much work a certain
machine ought to turn out. There was nothing for
him to do but either back down or study machine
tools and discover their maximum capacity. This
led him to investigate the matter of cutting speeds.
For years he spent all of his spare time studying
this subject, timing machines and experimenting
with different types of cutting tools. He estimated
that in the twenty-six years of his investigation he
converted 800,000 pounds of steel into chips. What
he wished to discover was the best depth of cut, the
best speed of cutting, and the best speed at which
the tool should be fed into the work. He soon discovered
that, contrary to prevailing opinion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
round-nosed tool was better than the diamond-pointed
tool, that the coarse slow-cutting speed was
better than a fine cut at high speed. He discovered
that the best method of lubricating the tools was to
keep them bathed in a heavy stream of water, supersaturated
with carbonate of soda, so as to prevent
the metal from rusting. The best tool steel of that
day was known as a self-hardening steel. Manufacturers
of the cutting steels had warned Taylor
that he must not use water on these tools. Taylor,
however, was not satisfied to take the word of
others, but proceeded to investigate the matter himself,
and discovered that he could safely increase the
cutting speed of his tools 33 per cent by the use of
a heavy stream of water for lubricating purposes.
This led Taylor and his associate, Maunsel White,
to investigate the different kinds of tool steels,
and eventually they evolved a chrome tungsten tool
which could do from two to four times the work of
other tools. Later vanadium was added to the alloy,
further improving the tool.</p>

<p>At the Exposition in Paris, in 1900, foreign manufacturers
were astonished to find enormous lathes
operating at high speed with the cutting tools taking
such heavy cuts and feeding so fast that the
nose of the tool was actually heated to a dull red
heat, and yet it kept its cutting edge perfectly. This
was a revelation to tool makers abroad, and it led
immediately to the adoption of American high-speed
cutting tools.</p>

<p>The development of the automobile, which began
to take on serious proportions at about that time,
is responsible above all other machines for improvements
in American machine tools, and for the extension
of the American system of interchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
manufacture. When automobiles came to be made
on the interchangeable system and in enormous
quantities so that the cost was reduced to within
the limits of the average man’s pocketbook, they
began to make mechanics of men who before that
had never used a tool; and this new and widespread
interest in machinery stimulated the production of
better and more efficient tools. Hence the progress
of machine tools in the past few years has been
simply phenomenal.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pch">COUNTING SECONDS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">YOU CAN measure civilization by its timepieces.
The higher the civilization of a community the
more it appreciates the value of time and the more
minutely does it measure the passage of time. The
savage divides his day into but two periods: the
period of light and that of darkness; the early
Romans divided their day into eight watches, four
watches of daylight and four of night, but the
higher and more complex civilization became, the
smaller became the subdivisions of time. People
began to feel the need of carrying the time with
them, and about 1500 A. D. watches came into use,
but it was not until 1665 that watches began to be
equipped with minute hands, and it was almost
exactly a century later that they were equipped with
a second hand. To-day time means so much to us
that we will fight our way into a subway express,
instead of riding more comfortably in a local train,
merely for the sake of saving five minutes. The
tiny second hands of our watches divide the day into
eighty-six thousand four hundred parts, and in some
operations we measure time intervals down to the
thousandth part of a second. Only among the most
highly civilized nations are timepieces carried by
the common people.</p>

<p>It used to be that time was made for slaves, but
now time has made slaves of us. Shift the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the clock and the whole nation is forced to change
its habits.</p>

<p>Time-measuring mechanism is given early prominence
in this book because clocks were among the
earliest machines invented, and they furnish an
example of the wonderful ingenuity of inventors before
the dawn of the modern era of machinery.
Naturally this chapter must be largely historical.</p>

<p>The first thought of measuring time came from
the ancient astronomers and astrologers, who, in
watching the motions of heavenly bodies, the sun by
day and the moon by day and night, found it necessary
to keep a record of these motions and sought
about for some mechanical means of doing so. The
studies of the old astrologers were closely associated
with religion, and as a consequence the most
advanced intellects were centered upon astronomical
matters and incidentally upon horology. Fortunately
the design and construction of mechanisms
for measuring time were not considered beneath the
dignity of the scientists of those early days. Mathematicians
felt free to record their investigations in
this branch of mechanics, and as a consequence of
the early cooperation of science and mechanics in
this field much real progress was made, and the
development of timepieces was more rapid than that
of any other machine.</p>

<h3>TELLING TIME WITH A LEAKY BUCKET</h3>

<p>The ancient Egyptians early felt the need of a
better clock than the sundial, because it operated
only on cloudless days and was absolutely worthless
to tell off the hours of darkness. Realizing
that time is a measure of motion, they sought for
some slowly moving body whose motion could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
used to measure time, and naturally they turned to
water. The earliest form of clock consisted merely
of a leaking bucket. Either the bucket was filled
with water which was allowed to escape through a
very tiny orifice, or else the heavily loaded bucket
was placed in water and the water was allowed to
leak into the bucket until it sank. The period it
took for a bucket to run dry or for a bucket to fill
and sink indicated a lapse of an hour or some other
standard of time.</p>

<p>The idea of subdividing this period was a later
development. As the water leaked out of a bucket,
the water level descended, but unfortunately not at
a uniform rate. The weight of water in a full
bucket made the drops come faster than when the
bucket was nearly empty. Consequently the time
graduations on the side of the bucket had to be set
farther apart at the top of the bucket than at the
bottom. Various ingenious schemes were devised
for maintaining a uniform discharge. In one type
of water clock or clepsydra a conical bucket was
used so that there would be a constant relation between
the head of water and the volume in the
bucket and the time graduations could be spaced
uniformly.</p>

<h3>THE REMARKABLE WATER CLOCK OF CTESIBIUS</h3>

<p>The most remarkable clepsydræ were those invented
by an old Alexandrian mathematician, Ctesibius,
who lived about 250 years before Christ.
Ctesibius introduced the siphon principle into his
clocks, and also employed gear wheels and even a
cord and pulley. Furthermore, he was the first man
to employ jeweled bearings in a timepiece. The use
of jewels in timepieces was reinvented in 1704 A. D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
However, Ctesibius used his jewels in a very
different way from that in which they are used
now, as will be described below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-069.jpg" width="400" height="743"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 25.&mdash;THE JEWELED WATER CLOCK BUILT
BY CTESIBIUS ABOUT 250 B. C.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Figure 25 illustrates the most interesting clock he
built and it was arranged to run year in and year
out. The clock had a cylindrical face mounted on a
hollow pedestal in which the mechanism was concealed.
The column was divided off into twenty-four
hours and a pointer that rose vertically marked
off the lapse of time. But here he was faced with
a serious complication. Hours in those days varied
with the time of the year. A day from sunrise to
sunset consisted of twelve hours. In summer, when
the days were long, the hours were long, and in the
short days of winter the hours were correspondingly
shortened. To be sure, the variations in the
length of the day are not so great in Egypt as they
are in our latitude, because it is nearer to the
equator; nevertheless there is a difference which
the precise old mathematician had to take into
account. In order to provide for variations in
the hours, Ctesibius ran the lines spirally around
the column and arranged his cylindrical clockface
to turn slightly each day, so that in the winter
months the clock hand or pointer moved over that
part of the face where the daylight hour lines were
closer together and the hours of night were farther
apart, while in summer, the reverse would obtain.
At the bottom of the column were two little cherubs.
The cherub on the left was a sad little fellow who
was constantly weeping. Tears trickled from his
eyes and dropped into a basin. The tears passed
into the hollow pedestal of the clock and gradually
filled a cylinder formed in the base of the clock.
A piston in this cylinder supported the other cherub.
As the water gradually filled the cylinder this
cherub was slowly raised and a wand he held in
his hand pointed off the hours on the clockface.
When the twenty-fourth hour was reached, a siphon
came into play, which suddenly emptied the cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
permitting the pointer to drop. The siphon discharged
its water into a small water wheel, which,
by means of the system of gears, turned the column
slightly to bring the hour lines in proper positions
for measuring the time intervals of the next day.
The column made one complete turn in 365 days.
The jeweled bearings, referred to above, were placed
in the eyes of the weeping boy, so that the holes
that pierced them would not be enlarged by the constant
wear of the water and thereby increase the
rate of flow.</p>

<h3>TIMING ANCIENT ORATORS</h3>

<p>We have dwelt at considerable length upon this
old clock of the pre-Christian era to show the ingenuity
of inventors of that day, and also the careful
study that was made of time by ancient mathematicians
and astronomers. Of course water clocks
were used before the time of Ctesibius. In fact,
we read of them in the comedies of Aristophanes,
written 400 B. C. Water clocks were used to limit
the long speeches of orators at court, and in one
place we find Demosthenes accusing a man of “talking
in my water,” while at another time, when he
was interrupted, he called to the officer to stop the
water, showing that he valued every moment of time
allotted to him for his speech.</p>

<p>In 807 Charlemagne was presented with a clock
by the King of Persia. This consisted of an elaborate
mechanism in which were all manner of wheels,
and the clock would actually strike the hours. The
driving power, however, was water.</p>

<p>But there were serious disadvantages in the use
of water for the measurement of time. No great
accuracy was ever obtainable with it, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fact that its volume varied considerably with the
temperature, and also with the dryness or moisture
in the surrounding atmosphere. The idea of using
a weight instead of water is claimed to have originated
as far back as 990 A. D. The next important
advance in the motive power of clocks was in 1500,
when Peter Hele of Nuremberg invented the mainspring.</p>

<p>That was long before the pendulum made its
appearance. The clock mechanism was slowed down
and kept under control by what was known as a
balance lever. (See Figure 26.) This was a horizontal
lever mounted to oscillate in a horizontal
plane. The lever was fitted with sliding weights,
so that it could be carefully adjusted. The last
wheel of the train of gears was provided with escapement
teeth, somewhat similar to those used on
our clocks and watches, but which would alternately
move the lever this way and that. The inertia of
the lever with the heavy weights on it was sufficient
to prevent the mechanism from racing, and by this
means, the motion was governed and slowed down, so
that it measured time with a fair degree of accuracy.</p>

<h3>DISCOVERY OF THE PENDULUM</h3>

<p>The pendulum had an interesting origin. Galileo,
while a student in Pisa in 1581, was attending
a service in the cathedral one day when his attention
was drawn to the swinging of a large hanging lamp.
One of the attendants had drawn the lamp toward
him, so that he could reach it more readily to light
it. When he let go the lamp began to swing slowly
back and forth, and the observant young student
noticed that although the oscillations gradually
slowed down the period of oscillation was constant.
He had no watch with which to measure the length
of the period, but being a medical student he knew
that he had a fair timepiece in his own heartbeats,
and so by counting his pulse he proved that it took
the lamp just as long to complete each oscillation
when it swept through a long arc as when it died
down to but a few inches. He made note of this
peculiar action and began experimenting with pendulums
of different lengths. Then it occurred to him
that if he could time the pendulum with his pulse
he could time his pulse with a pendulum. So he
devised a pendulum whose length could be adjusted
until its oscillation would coincide with the throb
of a patient’s pulse, and then the length of the pendulum
would give him the rate of the pulse beat.
The invention was seized upon by the medical profession
of that day, and the <i>pulsilogia</i>, as it was called,
became an indispensable instrument for physicians.</p>

<p>The idea of using the pendulum to control the action
of the clock also occurred to Galileo, and in later
years, after he had lost his sight, he passed the idea
down to his son, Vincent. However, it is generally
conceded that the credit for introducing the pendulum
and doing away with the balance lever belongs
to Christian Huygens, the Dutch mathematician,
whose first pendulum clock dates back to 1659.</p>

<p>About the same time Dr. Robert Hooke invented
the balance spring which made it unnecessary to use
the pendulum in portable timepieces. Prior to that
watches were fitted with balance levers and they
gave a great deal of trouble, because the time varied
with the position in which they were carried. But
the balance wheel overcame all these difficulties and
made it possible for a person to carry an accurate
timepiece in his vest pocket, although the early
watches were very bulky mechanisms.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST SHIP’S CHRONOMETER</h3>

<p>The importance of having accurate timepieces
aboard ship was felt as far back as the time of
Columbus. When ships began to go out beyond the
sight of land, it was highly important that they be
equipped with some means of locating their position
at sea. By noting the elevation of the sun at noon
with a sextant it was possible to determine the latitude
of the ship, but there was no means of determining
its longitude, except by dead reckoning, that
is, using a log to measure the speed of a ship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
estimating its position by calculating the number of
miles it had traveled since leaving port. If ships
could be provided with an accurate timepiece which
would keep the same time as that of some fixed
observatory, it would be possible definitely to locate
the position of the ship east or west by noting how
fast or slow the sun was at noon on the particular
day on which the observation was taken. This use
of the chronometer is common in these days, but up
to 150 years ago there was no timepiece sufficiently
accurate to permit a navigator to tell with any certainty
just where he was.</p>

<p>It was John Harrison, the son of a Yorkshire carpenter,
who was the first to build a chronometer
worthy of the name. A prize of 10,000 pounds was
offered by the British Parliament for anyone who
could invent and sell a chronometer which would
enable a ship to take a voyage from England to any
of the West Indian islands and back and keep track
of the longitude within one degree. If this could
be defined within two-thirds of a degree, the prize
would be 15,000 pounds. Harrison made a bid for
this prize, and after years of effort and patient
labor, he succeeded in being granted a trial. His
son, William, was sent on a ship to Jamaica with the
now celebrated chronometer, which was mounted
on a large cushion. The instrument was constantly
attended by the young man, its position being adjusted
from time to time to suit the “lie” of the ship.
When the ship was eighteen days out, the vessel
was estimated by dead reckoning to be 13° 50′ west
of Portsmouth, but the chronometer indicated the
position as 15° 19′. The timepiece was immediately
condemned as worthless, but William Harrison had
not lost faith in the instrument, and insisted that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the ship continued on the same course, a certain
island, if properly marked on the chart, would be
seen the following day. True to the prediction, the
next morning at seven o’clock the island appeared.
By means of his chronometer William Harrison was
able to predict the appearance of the other islands,
and at the end of the voyage, which occupied sixty-one
days, the chronometer was only nine seconds slow.
When he returned to Portsmouth, after an absence
of five months, the error of the chronometer was only
one minute and five seconds, giving an error in distance
of only eighteen miles, whereas thirty miles
was the margin of error allowed by the prize conditions.
Such accuracy seemed so incredible that the
chronometer had to be tested on a second voyage,
during which it was kept under lock and key and
when William Harrison had to wind the instrument
he was obliged to do so in the presence of two witnesses,
lest he move the hand of the chronometer
surreptitiously. At the end of the second voyage
there was no further doubt that Harrison was fully
entitled to the prize. Chronometers soon came to
be used extensively, until now they are one of the
most perfect of machines made by man, and operate
with an accuracy that is almost incredible. Usually
a ship is provided with several chronometers,
so that one may be used as a check upon another.
They are mounted in ball sockets and gimbal joints,
so that they are not affected by the roll of the ship,
but always lie in a horizontal position.</p>

<h3>MARVELOUS PRECISION OF MODERN WATCHES</h3>

<p>While we may well marvel at the precision of the
chronometer, it is equally marvelous, if not more so,
that we may equip ourselves for a few dollars with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a timepiece which is so wonderfully accurate as to
vary little more than a second per day. If one took
the pains to regulate his watch carefully, any of the
better makes could be adjusted to such accuracy.</p>

<p>There is nothing very mysterious about the mechanism
of a watch. It consists merely of a train of gears
which slow down the motions of the mainspring to
a convenient speed; and these gears moreover keep
the proper relation between the hour and minute
and second hands. But when we reflect that a small
watch possesses a tiny second hand which travels
something like ten miles in a year, and that if carefully
regulated it will not vary from that of another
watch in the whole journey by more than six or
eight inches at the most, we certainly have a reason
to marvel. There are 86,400 seconds in a day, and
a watch is usually arranged to make five beats per
second or 432,000 per day. The interval between
beats must be adjusted with such minuteness that
one beat must not differ from another by 1/86000 part
of a second, else the watch will register more than
a second fast or slow at the end of a day. And yet
watches capable of such precision are being turned
out daily by the thousands. Of course, such perfection
would be absolutely impossible without the use
of extremely accurate machine tools. It would have
been impossible as long as we had to depend upon
a watchmaker to make a watch by hand.</p>

<h3>THE PACEMAKER OF A WATCH</h3>

<p>If we look at the works of a clock the most conspicuous
feature is the rapidly oscillating balance
wheel which, by the way, is the most important
part of the watch, for it governs the release of the
power stored up in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>It controls the escapement which brings the whole
mechanism of the clock to a standstill five times
each second&mdash;in fact it is the pacemaker of the
watch, for it gives the watch a step-by-step movement
and fixes the rate at which the steps are taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-079.jpg" width="400" height="455"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">FIG. 27.&mdash;ESCAPEMENT OF A WATCH</p>
</div></div>

<p>The last wheel of the watch train is what is
known as an escape wheel. It is formed with teeth
of an odd shape, such as shown at A in Figure 27.
These teeth are engaged by a pair of pallets B
and C, carried by a three-armed lever D. The pallets
are usually bits of sapphire or similar hard
stone to prevent wear. The third of the lever is
slotted at its extremity to engage a sapphire pin E,
carried by a disk F, which is mounted on the staff
of the balance wheel. The escape wheel A revolves
in the direction of the arrow, being impelled by the
mainspring acting through the train of gears. One
of the teeth of this wheel engages the pallet B, causing
the lever D to swing on its axis and push the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sapphire pin E toward the left, thereby giving the
disk F an impulse in the same direction. Here a
delicate coil spring, known as the hairspring, comes
into play. Without the hairspring the parts would
stand still, the escape wheel being blocked by the
pallet B. The hairspring is attached at one end to
the shaft or staff of the disk F and the other to the
frame of the watch. It tries to hold the disk F in
a fixed position, but is disturbed by the action of
the escape wheel and is constantly oscillating the
disk in its effort to bring it back to its normal position.
When the disk swings over to the left the
pallet B is clear of the teeth of the escape wheel.
This releases the escape wheel and it springs forward
in the direction of the arrow, but before it
can move through an interval of one tooth it is arrested
by the second pallet C, which has been projected
into its path by the swing of the lever D.
The lever swings back until the pallet C clears the
escape wheel and the pallet B engages the next
tooth. And so the action continues, the lever swinging
back and forth and at each complete oscillation
releasing one tooth of the escape wheel.</p>

<p>The hairspring takes up the shock of this intermittent
motion and a balance wheel carried by the
staff to which F is fastened steadies the oscillatory
motion of the lever D. A watch is full of microscopic
parts. In a small timepiece there are machine-made
screws so small that without the aid of
a magnifying glass one cannot see the screw threads
cut upon them. But the most marvelous part of
the whole watch is the delicate hairspring and the
means of adjusting its tension and compensating
for its expansion and contraction with changes of
temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3>INANIMATE MATTER IN CONTINUAL MOTION</h3>

<p>When working with minute intervals of time
many factors must be considered which are not
even thought of in machines of grosser proportions.
It never occurs to the man in the street that not
only the animate world but the inanimate as well
is in ceaseless and variable motion. If our eyes were
capable of taking in minute microscopic details, we
should see that everything is expanding or contracting,
swelling or shriveling, twisting and warping
in response to the atmospheric changes. Our
steel bridges and skyscrapers are in constant motion;
solid concrete dams must be provided with expansion
joints; the Washington Monument goes
through a diurnal gyration in response to the sun’s
rays. Of course all this motion is almost immeasurably
small. A bar of steel a mile long will expand
⅖ of an inch for every increase of a degree Fahrenheit
in temperature. The expansion of a hairspring,
which may be nine or ten inches long, is
infinitesimally small and yet this must be considered
by the watchmaker. We must remember that the
escapement mechanism divides the day into 432,000
parts, each of which contains some minute error,
for absolute perfection is impossible, and if we add
up all these 432,000 errors they must not foot up to
more than a second per day. If the hairspring
expands ever so slightly its power is weakened, but
this loss of power is compensated by an ingenious
form of balance wheel. The rim is in two parts,
half of it being attached to one spoke of the wheel
and the other half to the other, as shown in Figure
28. Each half rim is formed of two strips of metal,
an inner strip of steel, and an outer strip of brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
fused together. Brass expands and contracts almost
twice as much as steel, and hence when there
is a rise of temperature the rim sections tend to
curl in, bringing their center of gravity nearer the
center of the wheel and making less of a load for
the weakened hairspring to move, while on the
other hand, when the spring is contracted by cold,
the rims spread out slightly, giving it a greater
load to oscillate. The weight of the balance wheel
is thus automatically adjusted against variations
in power of the spring.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 28.&mdash;THE SELF-CORRECTING BALANCE
WHEEL OF A WATCH</p>
</div></div>

<p>Aside from this automatic variable adjustment,
the balance wheel must have a primary permanent
adjustment. The rim of the wheel is loaded by
means of small screws. Screws placed near the free
ends of the rim sections will have a greater inward
or outward play as the rim contracts and expands,
and by their locations in different positions on the
rims the balance wheel may be adjusted with great
accuracy to compensate for temperature variation
in the hairspring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PENDULUM ESCAPEMENT</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-083.jpg" width="400" height="428"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 29.&mdash;PENDULUM ESCAPEMENT</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the case of clocks such delicacy of adjustment
is hardly necessary. Pendulum clocks, if they are
to run accurately, must have their pendulums automatically
adjustable for variations in temperature,
because the longer the pendulum the more slowly
it oscillates. Many years ago a grid type of pendulum
was invented in which various alloys were used,
which reacted one against the other and preserved
the center of gravity always at the same distance
from the center of oscillation. The action of a pendulum
movement is similar to that of a balance-wheel
movement described above. The pendulum
operates a pallet lever similar to that shown in Figure
29. The teeth of an escape wheel, which are
commonly somewhat different from those of the
watch movement, strike the pallets of the pallet
lever, and the escape wheel is intermittently stopped
and permitted to proceed. The pressure of the escapement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
teeth against the pallets is just enough
to keep the pendulum swinging and the speed of the
clock is regulated by lengthening or shortening the
pendulum.</p>

<p>We have added little to clock or watch movements
in recent years. About the only conspicuous modern
invention is the torsion pendulum. The pendulum
in this case is a heavy horizontal disk suspended
by a wire, and the disk rotates first in one
direction and then in the other, twisting and untwisting
the wire. The advantage of this pendulum
is that the oscillations are very slow, and hence
it is possible to keep the clock going for a year at
a single winding.</p>

<p>The electric regulation of clocks is another important
improvement. A clock need not be a very
perfect timepiece, but if provided with an electric
regulator its hands are brought up to the correct
time every hour in response to an impulse sent from
an accurate master clock which in turn has its time
corrected daily from the National Observatory in
Washington.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="pch">PUTTING RIVERS TO WORK</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">FLOWING water exerts a strange fascination
upon mankind, even to the present day. Tourists
travel hundreds of miles to view the glorious
spectacle of a riotous tumbling cataract. Is it
strange, then, that in the olden times, when the world
was peopled with gods and genii and strange spirits,
the ancients looked upon ceaselessly flowing rivers
as the symbol of life? It was most natural for them
to covet the endless power of a river and eventually,
despite their superstitions, to try to utilize some of
its energy.</p>

<p>It may be that sailboats antedate the first water
wheel, but it seems much more probable that flowing
water was the first inanimate power harnessed by
man. Windmills were certainly a later development.
They possessed the advantage that they
could be located anywhere while the water mill had
of necessity to be built along the bank of a stream.
However, the power of the wind is so unreliable
and fluctuates so widely that it was little used,
except in flat countries, where there was little if
any available water power.</p>

<p>Water power predominated until the steam engine
was introduced, when it had to give way to an even
more reliable power and one which could be located
at any place to which fuel could be transported.
Now, however, we are going back to our first power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
seeking it out in the most inaccessible mountainous
regions, because we have discovered the means of
taking the power it yields and transmitting it hundreds
of miles, over hills and plains to the point
where we can put it to useful service. Hydroelectric
power has very aptly been termed “white coal.”</p>

<p>The first prime motor was the current wheel, that
is, a wheel fitted with paddles, which was journaled
over a stream with the paddles projecting into the
water. This was a very inefficient machine; it converted
very little of the energy of a stream into useful
mechanical power. The idea of damming the
stream and letting the waters flow over the dam
through a raceway upon a water wheel was a much
later development.</p>

<h3>WATER WHEELS</h3>

<p>Three types of water wheel which were in universal
use before the advent of the steam engine
were the undershot wheel, the overshot wheel, and
the breast wheel (Figure 30). In the undershot
wheel the water stored back of a dam is let out near
the bottom of the dam and strikes the under side of
the wheel, so that the top of the wheel turns toward
the dam. In the overshot wheel, the water flows
over the wheel striking the paddles or buckets on
top and on the forward side, so that the wheel turns
forward. In the breast wheel, the water strikes the
paddles half way up the wheel on the rear side and
drives the wheel in the same direction as that of
the undershot wheel.</p>

<p>When we speak of water power we are apt to
think of the water as actually furnishing the energy.
As a matter of fact, it is not water but gravity that
drives the wheel, the water being merely the medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that gravity acts upon. By having the water
drop from a great height, its velocity is greatly increased
and the power it imparts to the wheel is
much higher. In mountainous regions it is easy to
obtain a high head of water and thus generate a
great deal of power from a relatively small stream.
However, the ancient type of wheel with its paddles
or buckets has now practically passed out of existence,
being superseded by the Pelton wheel for high
heads and the turbine for low heads of water.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE PELTON WHEEL</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 31.&mdash;SECTIONAL VIEW OF A PAIR OF PELTON WHEEL
BUCKETS SHOWING HOW THE WATER JET IS DIVIDED
AND FOLLOWS THE CONTOUR OF THE BUCKETS</p>
</div></div>

<p>In California, a number of years ago, they made
use of what was known as the hurdy-gurdy wheel.
This consisted of an ordinary wheel with bucket-shaped
paddles against which was directed a stream
of water at high velocity through a nozzle. There
was a carpenter, named L. A. Pelton, who used to
make a business of building and repairing such
wheels and the flumes that carried the water to
them. Although uneducated, he was possessed of
considerable native ingenuity and was a very observant
man. One day, when he was called in to
repair a wheel, he noticed that one of the buckets
which had been misplaced received the water from
the nozzle without any splashing. The water struck
the edge of the bucket with practically no shock,
whereas the other buckets produced a great deal of
splashing. Pelton had enough knowledge of the
principles of mechanics to realize that a splash
means a waste of energy, and that here was a bucket
which, although out of plumb and apparently defective,
was really more efficient than any of the
others in the wheel. It occurred to him then that instead
of having the jet of water strike the middle
of the buckets it ought to strike the edge, so that all
its power would be absorbed without any wasteful
splashing. He might have displaced the jet laterally
so as to accomplish this result, but he realized that
that would have produced a considerable side
thrust on the wheel, which, of course, would have
been objectionable, and so he hit upon the plan of
using double buckets and letting the stream of water
strike the pair of buckets along their dividing line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
(See Figure 31.) This would split the stream in
two and let each half strike the slanting face of the
bucket, and follow the surface around in the same
way that it did on the single misplaced bucket, but
the reaction or side thrust on one bucket would be
counteracted by that on the other. This idea proved
successful and out of it has grown the Pelton wheel
which is now universally used in all power plants
employing high heads of water.</p>

<h3>A 4,000-FOOT HEAD OF WATER</h3>

<p>A notable illustration of such a plant is the great
installation at Big Creek, Cal. Big Creek, despite
its name, used to be a small stream flowing down
the mountains into a canyon. One would hardly
suppose that it was capable of yielding much power,
but it had its source high up in the Sierras and was
fed mainly by melting snows. In the springtime, it
swelled to a good-sized torrent. By building three
dams near the top of the mountain, a lake was
formed in which the water of the melting snow was
impounded, so that a steady stream of water could
be supplied the year round for power purposes. But
even so, the stream hardly amounts to very much if
we consider only the quantity of water that passes
through it. The particular advantage of this installation
is the fact that in a distance of six miles
from the dam the creek falls 4,000 feet.</p>

<p>An inhabitant of the Eastern States who is unused
to mountain heights may gain some conception
of the meaning of this elevation by gazing up to the
pinnacle of the Woolworth Tower, which rises 795
feet above street level, then mentally multiplying its
altitude by five. Evidently even a small stream of
water dropping from such an elevation would develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
an enormous amount of power. In fact, it
was considered inexpedient to use the entire fall at
a single drop and so it was divided into two stages.
The water is carried through a tunnel three-quarters
of a mile long and then through a flow pipe
along the face of the mountain to a point where it
may drop 2,000 feet to the first power plant. After
passing through this plant the water is discharged
into the creek and is then diverted into a second
tunnel four miles long and a series of steel conduits
to a point from which it may drop 2,000 feet more
to the second power plant. In each power house
there are two electric generators, each fitted with a
pair of Pelton wheels. These wheels are a little
less than eight feet in diameter and each one develops
23,000 horsepower.</p>

<p>The water is directed into the buckets of the Pelton
wheel in a stream six inches in diameter, and it
issues from the nozzle with a velocity of 300 feet
per second or about 210 miles per hour. A jet of
water is almost like a solid bar of wood. In fact,
it is impossible to chop through it with an ax. The
water would swing the ax out of one’s hand before
it got part way through the jet. Traveling at such
a high speed the friction is so great that it would
tear the skin off one’s hands, if it did not actually
tear the hand off the arm, and yet it strikes the
buckets of the wheels with no shock at all, for the
first part of the bucket it touches is nearly parallel
to the jet, and as the water sweeps around the
curved face of the bucket it loses practically all of
its pressure and velocity and falls into the tail race.
The electric power generated by the two plants is
stepped up to 150,000 volts and sent out over transmission
lines to points of service. The street cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of Los Angeles are connected by a 240-mile electric
harness to the hydraulic horses of Big Creek.</p>

<p>Powerful as this stream is, a still higher head is
used in Switzerland, at Lake Fully, where there is
a drop of over a mile in a distance of 2.8 miles. The
water is carried by a short tunnel through the mountain,
and then makes a drop of over 5,000 feet to the
power plant, where it strikes the Pelton wheels at a
velocity of 400 miles per hour, or about seven times
the speed of a fast express train.</p>

<h3>HARNESSING THE MISSISSIPPI</h3>

<p>In contrast to such high heads, we have the low-head
power plants which are employed where a
large volume of water is available. The most
notable installation of this type, and the largest
in the world, is that at Keokuk, Iowa, where a
dam has been thrown across the Mississippi River.
For many years it was thought impossible to make
any use of the vast volume of water that flows
through this great river. But above Keokuk there
used to be a rapid extending back about twelve
miles. By building a dam across the river just below
the rapid it was possible to obtain a working
head of about thirty-two feet, and with the enormous
volume of water available this provided sufficient
energy to make the development worth while.
In marked contrast to the installation at Big Creek,
it is volume rather than velocity that is employed,
and hence turbines rather than Pelton wheels are
used. More water goes through a single turbine
than is used in the whole of the city of New York
with all its elaborate aqueduct system. Enormous
turbines are used, fifteen feet in diameter, and when
the installation is complete there will be thirty units,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
each yielding 10,000 horsepower, or a total of 300,000
horsepower. A turbine, it may be explained,
differs from the ordinary water wheel in the fact
that the water runs through the wheel instead of
around it (Figure 32). The water may enter at
the center and then flow out at the periphery, or it
may enter at the periphery and then be discharged
from the center of the wheel, or it may run axially
through the wheel. In a Pelton wheel there is a
single jet which strikes but one pair of buckets at
a time, but in a turbine there are many jets distributed
all around the circumference of the wheel.
The water is divided into a series of jets by being
forced through a stationary set of curved vanes.
The blades of the rotor or revolving part of the
turbine are oppositely curved. If the rotor were
immovable the jets would have to change their
direction in passing through the rotor, but as
the rotor is free to turn, the jets react against
these blades and set the wheel to revolving. The
turbine may be designed to run either on a horizontal
axis or on a vertical one.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 32.&mdash;TURBINE WHEELS; INFLOW TYPE SHOWN ON
THE LEFT AND OUTFLOW TYPE ON THE RIGHT</p>
</div></div>

<p>The turbines used at the Keokuk plant are of the
inflow type. The rotor is mounted on a vertical shaft
in a scroll-shaped concrete chamber, something like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
a snail shell. Water pouring into this chamber is
thus given a swirling motion in the direction of
rotation of the wheel. As it flows into the wheel
it passes first through a ring of fixed vanes, which
divide it into the jets.</p>

<p>The highest velocity of a wheel is naturally at the
periphery and the advantage of an inflowing turbine
such as this is that the water is traveling at its
highest velocity when it strikes the periphery of the
rotor. As it loses its velocity it flows in toward
the slower-moving portions of the rotor. Finally it
reaches the center, after giving up practically all its
energy, and falls into the tail pool through a draft
tube at the center of the rotor.</p>

<p>The scroll chambers at Keokuk are thirty-nine feet
in diameter and the draft tubes are eighteen feet in
diameter. Water enters the scroll chambers with
a velocity of fourteen feet per second and comes
out of the draft tubes into the tail pool with its
velocity cut down to but four feet per second.
Compare this with the velocity of the water jets at
Big Creek!</p>

<p>The current generated at Keokuk goes to St.
Louis and surrounding towns and serves a population
of 1,120,000.</p>

<p>Now that we have learned how to transmit electrical
power without serious loss over enormous distances,
it is only a question of time before all the
water power in the world is harnessed and put to
the service of man. The power costs nothing after
once the plant has been built; the only expense is
that of maintaining the machinery and keeping it
in repair. It is estimated that there is some 200,000,000
horsepower available in this country, but
this includes all flowing water, much of which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
would be impracticable, if not almost impossible, to
utilize. However, there is about 60,000,000 horsepower
commercially available, according to the
figures of the U. S. Geological Survey, of which we
have developed so far only 6,000,000 horsepower.</p>

<p>The ancients used flowing streams not so much
for power purposes as to lift water to a higher level
so that it would flow into their irrigating ditches.
Nowadays, electricity, steam, or air is used for
elevating water, but we have a very ingenious machine
which makes the stream lift a part of itself.
This machine is very different in principle from the
old Egyptian noria. It depends upon the kinetic energy
of water in motion. You cannot push a nail
into a piece of wood with a hammer but you can
easily drive it in by striking it with the hammer.
As the hammer is swung it acquires what we term
kinetic energy or energy of motion.</p>

<h3>SETTING KITCHEN FAUCETS TO WORK</h3>

<p>It is not generally realized that water in motion
also acquires kinetic energy. Whenever a faucet
is turned off very quickly, there is a hammering
sound which is due to the fact that the moving water
in the water pipe is brought to an abrupt stop. This
puts a severe strain on the piping. A great deal
of trouble was experienced from this source in the
early days of plumbing. At a hospital in Bristol,
England, there was a lead pipe leading from a cistern
in one of the upper stories to the kitchen.
Every time the faucets were turned off abruptly the
momentum of the water caused the lead pipe to expand,
and every now and then the pipe was burst.
In order to relieve the situation, a plumber connected
a pipe to the faucet and carried it up the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the building to the level of the cistern. His idea
was that whenever the water was turned off suddenly
it would have a vent leading up to the level of
the water reservoir. Much to his surprise, the water
issued from the pipe in a jet of considerable height.
To prevent the escape of the water, he extended the
pipe considerably, and still a jet of water would
issue from it. Eventually the relief pipe was carried
up twice the height of the cistern and even then the
water would squirt out occasionally when the faucets
in the kitchen were turned off very suddenly. Then
the idea was conceived of placing a reservoir on one
of the upper floors of the hospital and letting the jet
of water fill this reservoir. Every time the faucet
was operated in the kitchen a certain amount of
water flowed into the new cistern, and in this way
it was kept supplied with enough water to furnish
that which was required for the upper floors of the
hospital.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 33.&mdash;SECTIONAL VIEW OF A WATER RAM</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is on this principle that the hydraulic ram operates.
Water from a stream is made to flow down a
pipe, and as it gains velocity a check valve suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
stops the flow which produces enough pressure to
force open a valve in an air chamber and let some
of the water enter the chamber. As soon as the
pressure is relieved the check valve opens and the
valve into the chamber closes automatically until a
moment later the stream of water has gained sufficient
velocity to repeat the performance. Thus an
intermittent jet of water is forced into the air
chamber and thence through a pipe to a reservoir.
The height to which the water will rise depends entirely
upon the velocity of the water flowing through
the system. The air chamber is necessary to cushion
the action of the hydraulic ram and provide a fairly
steady pressure upon the water that flows up
through the vent pipe. The check valve is entirely
automatic. It is held open against the pressure of
the water by a spring or a weight, but when the
water is in motion is dragged shut, only to spring
open again when the pressure is reduced by the
escape of the water into the air chamber.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a very ingenious water-driven motor
which is employed merely to record the amount of
water flowing through it. This is the Thomson
water meter which is illustrated in Figure 34. It
consists of a circular chamber with inwardly dished
or conical top and bottom walls. In the chamber is
a flat disk with a ball and socket bearing. At one
side there is a vertical diaphragm in the chamber
which passes through a slot in the disk. This prevents
the disk from revolving, but it is free to oscillate.
It has a motion similar to the gyrations of a
top when it is beginning to lose speed and die down,
except that the disk does not revolve. When the
disk is in contact with the bottom wall of the chamber
on one side it contacts with the top wall on the
other so that the chamber is virtually divided into
two compartments by the disk, but by gyrating the
disk these compartments are made to revolve. Water
enters at one side and discharges at the other side
of the vertical diaphragm. Now, if the disk is in the
position shown in Figure 34, the water, on entering,
bears upon the upper face of the inclined disk and
wedges its way between the disk and the upper wall
of the chamber, making the disk oscillate on its ball
center. As the edge of the disk rises across the
face of inlet port the water entering the chamber
bears against the under side of the disk, continuing
the gyratory motion. The water cut off on the upper
side of the disk is carried around to the outlet and
discharges, while a fresh supply flows in on the
other side of the vertical partition and at the next
half turn the water in the lower compartment discharges
at the outlet side of the partition, while the
compartment is filling on the other side of the partition.
A measured amount of water flows through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the chamber at each gyratory oscillation of the disk.
A train of gearing is driven by the gyrating disk
which operates a set of dial pointers and a measure
of the amount of water passing through the
meter is indicated.</p>

<h3>DIGGING WITH WATER JETS</h3>

<p>We have referred to the enormous velocity of the
jets used to drive Pelton wheels. Where high heads
of water are obtainable water jets are used very
effectively for excavating purposes, particularly in
mining plants for washing down gold-bearing
gravel banks. If water is not found near such banks
expensive canals, flumes, and pipe lines are constructed
and even tunnels are bored to bring the
water to the point where it can be utilized. Some
of the giant nozzles spout streams from 2 to 8 inches
in diameter with a pressure of from 50 to 200
pounds per square inch. The powerful streams tear
into the gravel banks, washing them away into
sluices in which riffle boxes are placed to catch the
precious metal. The back pressure of these nozzles
is very heavy and the larger ones have to be provided
with strong anchorages. Water in motion resists
any change of direction and long levers have
to be provided to permit the miners to guide the
nozzles.</p>

<p>The hydraulic jet is also used for general excavating
wherever water power is available. Sometimes
it is employed under water when clearing a channel
to level down piles of stones that are too large to be
picked up by a suction dredge. Hollow iron piles
are driven into a sandy bottom by means of
hydraulic jets. No hammer is needed. Water is
pumped into the pile and on issuing from the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the pile it carries sand with it, making a hole into
which the pile sinks. Wooden piles are driven in
the same way by loosely attaching a water pipe to
them so that the pipe may be withdrawn when the
pile has been driven far enough. The pile is grooved
at the lower end so that the pipe outlet may be centered
at the bottom of the pile.</p>

<h3>COMPRESSING AIR WITH WATER</h3>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 35.&mdash;HOW THE VENA CONTRACTA
RAISES WATER</p>
</div></div>

<p>A very ingenious apparatus for compressing air
was invented in the earliest years of the iron age
to furnish a continuous blast of air for the Catalan
forges. This compressor, known as a “trompe,” can
hardly be termed a machine because it contains no
moving parts except water, which is the motive
power, and the air which it traps and compresses.
To understand its operation we must look into a
peculiar property of water flowing out of a reservoir
into a pipe or nozzle. There is a converging
motion that tends to contract the jet of water just
after it leaves the pipe. This is known as the <i>vena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
contracta</i>. It produces a partial vacuum in the pipe.
If air ports are opened into the pipe at this point, air
will be sucked in to fill the vacuum and will be
carried out of the pipe by the friction of the water.
In Figure 35 a pipe is shown running from the <i>vena
contracta</i> to a water tank below. The rise of water
in this pipe indicates the degree of vacuum produced
by the jet.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 36.&mdash;THE “TROMPE” BY WHICH COMPRESSED
AIR WAS FURNISHED FOR CATALAN FORGES</p>
</div></div>

<p>This principle is used in the hydraulic-air compressor
or “trompe” as it is called. Water flows
out of one reservoir through a pipe into another
reservoir lower down. (See Figure 36.) Air enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the pipe through ports at the point where the vein
of water contracts and is carried down into the second
reservoir. This reservoir is sealed so that the
air is trapped in it. The water passes out through
a pipe which is carried high enough to keep a certain
pressure of air in the reservoir and prevent it
from blowing out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 37.&mdash;DIAGRAMMATIC SECTION OF A LARGE HYDRAULIC
AIR COMPRESSOR IN MICHIGAN</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is a compressor of this type, constructed on
an enormous scale, in the northern part of Michigan.
A sketch of the compressor is given in Figure 37.
The air reservoir in this case is a huge underground
rock-walled chamber nearly 350 feet below the surface,
8 feet wide, 26 feet high, and about 280 feet
long. There are three intake pipes, 5 feet in diameter,
each filled with an annular funnel-shaped head,
which sucks air into the water and carries it down
into the chamber. At the bottom of each intake pipe
there is a concrete block with a conical top projecting
up into the pipe. The column of water flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
down the pipe is spread out into an annular stream
by the conical block and the bubbles of air escape
into the chamber. The water outlet of the chamber
is an inclined shaft which leads up about 270 feet
to the surface of the ground where it discharges
into the tail race. The water is forced up this inclined
shaft by the pressure of the air trapped in
the chamber. The mouth of the shaft is, of course,
below the level of the water in the chamber so that
there is no chance for the air to escape unless the
pressure becomes excessively high, when it will
force the water level below the mouth of the shaft
and blow out. The discharge sometimes forms a
geyser 700 feet high. The air will continue to blow
until the pressure is reduced enough for the water
level to rise and cut off access of the air to the
mouth of the shaft. Under normal conditions there
is a fall of 343 feet from the water level at the top
of the intake pipe to the water level in the chamber,
and a vertical rise of 271 feet from the water level in
the chamber to the tail-water level. The difference,
or 72 feet, represents the working head. With all
three intakes operating, a total of 5,000 horsepower
is developed. Each intake delivers 11,930 cubic feet
of air per minute at a pressure of 128 pounds. Air
enters the intake heads through tubes ⅜ inch in
diameter and there are 1,800 of them to each head.
The air is employed to operate machinery and tools
in an adjacent mine.</p>

<p>One advantage of this type of air compressor is
that it cools the air while compressing it. This was
hardly an advantage in the Catalan forges, but
when the air is used to drive machinery it is important
that it be precooled. When air is compressed
by mechanical means a great deal of heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
is generated and the machines must be water
jacketed to extract this heat, but in the hydraulic
compressor the air bubbles are compressed as they
pass down with the water to the reservoir and the
water absorbs the heat, delivering cool compressed
air at the bottom of the intake pipe.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">LIQUID LEVERS AND GEARS</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">MANY an inventor has strayed off into the delusive
pursuit of perpetual motion because he
did not know that the pressure in a body of water
at any given point is equal in all directions, upward,
downward, or laterally.</p>

<p>A cubic foot of water weighs 62½ pounds. Take
a hollow column with an internal cross-sectional
area of one square foot and if it be filled with water
to a depth of ten feet there will be a weight of 625
pounds of water in the column and hence a pressure
of 625 on the bottom of the tube or 4.34 pounds on
every square inch of the bottom. But the water
presses on the sides of the tube as well and the
amount of this pressure depends upon the depth or
“head” of water and not upon the quantity of water.
At the bottom of the tube the pressure on the side
walls is 625 pounds per square foot or 4.34 pounds
per square inch; at a depth of one foot the pressure
on the side walls is 62.5 pounds per square foot or
.434 pound per square inch; at a depth of two feet
it will be .864 pound per square inch, etc. The
pressure on each square inch depends not upon the
mass of the water but upon its depth. If the column
of water had a cross-sectional area of a mile or a
thousand miles, the pressure at a depth of one foot
would always be .434 pound per square inch. (Of
course there are slight variations from this figure
due to salt or other substances dissolved in water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
or to changes in density produced by variations of
temperature, but we need not consider such minute
differences here.) That is why a dam which is
strong enough to hold back the waters of a pond
will be just as able to hold back the waters of the
whole ocean if it be placed in a sheltered bay where
ocean waves cannot tear it to pieces. The ocean,
despite its enormous mass, can exert no more pressure
per foot of depth than the water in a cistern.</p>

<h3>WHY A SHIP FLOATS</h3>

<p>It is because the pressure of water at a given
depth is exerted upward, as well as laterally and
downward, that a ship floats. It is the upward
pressure of the water that holds up the boat. When
an object is placed in a reservoir of water it sinks
into zones of increasing pressure until it finally
reaches a depth at which the pressure on the bottom
of the object balances the weight of the body. If
the body is entirely submerged before reaching such
a point, it will continue to sink to the bottom of the
reservoir because water will flow over the top of the
object and keep adding downward pressure to offset
the increasing upward pressure. The amount of
water in the reservoir makes no difference. A battleship
will float just as high in a flooded dry dock
as it will in the open ocean. If the dry dock were
so narrow as to leave a clearance of but a few inches
of water around the ship, the latter would still float
even though the ship weighed considerably more
than the water in the dock.</p>

<p>There is a big difference, then, between the weight
of water and the pressure it exerts. In Figure 38
we have an L-shaped receptacle with the lower arm
of the L terminating in a chamber A. The top wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
B of this chamber measures ten square inches. The
tube C has a cross sectional area of one square inch.
If tube C is filled to a height of twelve inches above
wall B we shall have an upward pressure of 0.434
pound on every square inch of wall B, or a total
of 4.34 pounds. If by means of a plunger D we add
a hundred pounds of pressure to the column of water
in tube C, we shall be adding a thousand pounds to
the pressure on the wall B. The side walls and bottom
of the chamber A will also be subjected to a
pressure of 1,000 pounds per inch plus the pressure
due to the depth or head of water.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 39.&mdash;PRINCIPLE OF THE
HYDRAULIC PRESS</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here, then, we have a convenient means of
multiplying force or effort and it is a means that is
used very largely in certain classes of machinery.
Figure 39 is a diagrammatic representation of a
hydraulic press. It consists of a cylinder A in which
is fitted a ram B. An L-shaped tube C connects
with the cylinder and is fitted with a plunger D. The
cylinder and tube are filled with water and then
when the plunger is depressed the ram B has to rise,
If the area of the plunger is one square inch and that
of the ram thirty square inches, a 100 pounds pressure
on the plunger will exert 3,000 pounds of lift
on the ram.</p>

<h3>HYDRAULIC LEVERAGE</h3>

<p>However, we must remember that in mechanics,
as in all walks of life, we cannot get “something for
nothing.” If we multiply the pressure or force, we
must pay for it in some way, otherwise we should be
getting more work out of the press than we put in it,
which is what the perpetual motion crank is ever
trying to do. As the cross-sectional area of the
plunger D is only 1/30th of that of the ram, the
plunger must descend thirty inches to raise the ram
one inch. We need not consider the difference in
the head of water because it would not amount to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
more than a few ounces at most, nor need we consider
frictional losses. The case is parallel to that
of the lever. In fact, we may consider the hydraulic
press as a fluid lever with the water in tube C as the
effort arm and that in cylinder A as the weight arm.
The two arms are here so proportioned that the
power arm must move thirty times as far as the
weight arm. The work put into the press is exactly
balanced by that we get out of it. An effort of 100
pounds exerted through a distance of thirty inches is
exactly balanced by the moving of 3,000 pounds
through a distance of one inch.</p>

<p>It is a decided disadvantage to have to move the
plunger so far and in actual commercial practice
hand-operated hydraulic presses are not worked in
that way. A pump is used to force water into the
cylinder so that a great many short strokes may be
taken in place of one long one, and the pump handle
provides an added leverage, enabling a man with
little effort to exert an enormous lift. The water
enters the ram cylinder through a valve, and the
pressure is maintained on the ram until relieved by
the opening of an outlet port.</p>

<h3>MAUDSLEY’S LEATHER COLLAR</h3>

<p>All this seems very simple and one would suppose
that the inventor of the hydraulic press must have
been exceptionally free from the troubles and trials
that beset most inventors. However, there is a vast
difference between a laboratory apparatus and a
commercial machine. When, towards the close of the
eighteenth century, Joseph Bramah, the eminent
British tool builder, invented the hydraulic press, he
experienced all sorts of difficulty in holding the
water in the ram cylinder. Of course, the ram has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to slide freely into and out of the cylinder, but how
could he prevent the water from leaking out past
the ram? He resorted to all the plumbing expedients
of the day. He used a stuffing box and gland,
but when this was packed tight enough to hold the
water in, it gripped the ram so tightly that the
latter would not move down into the cylinder on the
return stroke. Bramah had in his employ a very
clever young mechanic named Henry Maudsley,
who later became famous as an inventor and designer
of machine tools. We read of him in Chapter
III. Maudsley attacked the baffling problem of the
hydraulic press and provided a solution that survives
to this day. In place of the stuffing box which
is a means of jamming a mass of cotton waste about
the collar, he provided a cupped leather collar. When
the pressure was applied it expanded the collar and
made it bear tightly against the ram, but on relieving
the hydraulic pressure the pressure of the cup
leather was also reduced automatically.</p>

<p>There are many machines analogous to the hydraulic
press in principle. They do not use water
in every case for the fluid lever. Where the fluid
is used over and over again oil is frequently employed.
The compactness of this form of lever
makes it most useful wherever an operation calls
for the overcoming of a very heavy load or resistance
through a relatively short distance. For instance,
there are machines for bending pipe, for
curving railroad rails, for punching holes in metal,
for pulling wheels off their shafts, for jacking up
heavy weights, for baling cotton, paper, and other
materials, all of which operate on the same principle
as the hydraulic press. Water pressure is supplied
sometimes by a hand pump, sometimes by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
power-driven pump, and sometimes it is taken from
a reservoir in which compressed air imparts the
requisite pressure to the water.</p>

<h3>BLASTING WITH WATER</h3>

<p>A novel use of water pressure has been developed
in England. In certain mines it is dangerous to use
dynamite for blasting purposes owing to the presence
of explosive gases, and successful experiments
have been made with hydraulic cartridges. This
consists of a cylinder of steel fitted with a series of
little plungers arranged in a row in the cylindrical
wall of the cartridge. As in powder blasting, a
series of holes are drilled in the face of the rock
and the cartridges with the plungers retracted are
fitted into the holes. Then the cartridges are connected
to a high-pressure water supply. The water
forces the plungers out, exerting enough pressure to
burst the rock. Not only is this system perfectly
safe, but it is economical, because the gallery does
not have to be cleared of workmen before every
blast. There is more certainty in the use of water
cartridges, and the danger, common where dynamite
is used, of having the rock drill or pick strike and
explode a stick of dynamite which failed to go off
with the rest of the charge in a previous blast is
avoided.</p>

<p>Hydraulic pressure is also used in jacks for lifting
heavy weights. The principle of the hydraulic
jack is the same as that of the hydraulic press.</p>

<h3>RAISING A BRIDGE SPAN WITH WATER</h3>

<p>An interesting illustration of the use of these
liquid levers was afforded in the construction of the
Quebec Bridge. This huge bridge, it will be recalled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
consists of two cantilevers which stretch out from
opposite shores of the St. Lawrence River and support
between them a center span 640 feet long and
weighing 5,400 tons. The span was built on barges,
towed down to position between the cantilever arms
and then lifted up 150 feet to the floor level of the
bridge. Eight 1,000-ton hydraulic lifting jacks
were used, two at each corner of the span. They
were ideally suited to this kind of work. The bridge
span had to be lifted with utmost care and the motion
had to be simultaneous on all four corners. If
one corner were raised faster than another the span
would be twisted and subjected to serious strains.
In the first attempt the fastening gave way at one
corner and the span crumpled up and plunged down
into the river. But a year later at the second attempt
the span was hoisted successfully to position.
The jacks had a lift of two feet, and, counting the
time required to secure the huge plate chains by
which the span was suspended, move the jacks down
and give them a fresh hold, it took fourteen minutes
to complete each two-foot lift. The work was done
only during the daylight hours and on the third
day the span was finally brought into position and
made fast to the cantilever arms by means of twelve-inch
pins driven home at each corner.</p>

<p>Hydraulic power is used very largely in the operation
of cranes. As the plunger or ram has a very
limited range of motion some means of multiplying
distance of travel is required. One simple scheme is
to use a set of pulley wheels or sheaves attached
to the cylinder and another set to the ram and pass
the hoisting chain around them. If we refer back to
Figure 16, on page 34, we shall see that seven feet of
rope must be pulled in at E in order to raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
lower pulley block one foot. It is very evident that
the process can be reversed. Power might be applied
to spread the two-pulley blocks apart when a
movement of one foot would produce a travel of
seven feet at E. That is what is done on the hydraulic
crane. The ram is lifted, spreading the pulley
blocks apart and thus multiplying the motion of the
lifting cable to any extent, depending upon the
number of sheaves, so that a travel of but a few
feet will result in lifting a load forty or fifty feet.</p>

<h3>HYDRAULIC ELEVATORS</h3>

<p>The same principle is used in hydraulic elevators.
The hydraulic cylinder lies horizontally on the basement
floor and by means of pulley gearing a short
motion of the plunger is sufficient to raise the car
several stories.</p>

<p>In a more modern type of elevator the plunger
acts directly on the car. The plunger is long enough
to reach to the top story of the building which means
that it must sink far into the ground in order to let
the car down to the first story or basement. A steel
pipe is sunk into the ground and serves as the cylinder
and in this the long plunger operates. In one
of New York’s tall buildings the cars are lifted to
a height of 282 feet. The plungers are 6½ inches
in diameter and they travel at a speed of over 400
feet per minute. The car which, when loaded,
weighs 1,617 pounds, is supported on the top of the
plunger. However, counterweights are provided
which balance the weight of the car, so that practically
the only weight lifted by the plunger is that
of the passengers. The advantage of this type of
elevator is that it reduces the danger of accident.
The motion of the car is steady and easily controlled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The car cannot move down above a given
speed and the only possible danger is that the
plunger might break. However, a shaft of steel
6½ inches in diameter, even if hollow, is hardly
likely to give way even under the most extraordinary
loads to which it might be subjected in elevator
service.</p>

<h3>LIFT LOCKS FOR CANALS</h3>

<p>There is another type of elevator that completely
dwarfs anything used in office buildings. On some
canals where it is necessary to make a sudden
change of level of considerable extent, instead of
using a flight of locks, a hydraulic elevator is employed
to lift or lower not only the vessel but the
water it is floated in. There are two huge tanks
which ply between the upper and lower levels of the
canal. These are so connected that as one rises the
other descends. The tanks are big enough to take
in the largest vessels that are likely to use the canal.
They are fitted with water-tight gates at each end,
and after a vessel has entered one of them, say at
the lower level, the gate behind it is closed. Then
hydraulic mechanism is operated to lift the tank,
and when the top is reached the other gate is opened
and the vessel sails out into the upper level. It
seems like a tremendous undertaking to lift a heavy
ship, but the two tanks balance each other and the
only work that has to be done is to overcome the
friction and inertia. No matter how heavy a vessel
may be, it will not disturb the balance between the
two tanks. Nor is it necessary to have a ship in
each tank, for the same depth of water is maintained
in the two tanks, and when a ship enters the
weight of the tank is not increased, for the ship
displaces its own weight of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<h3>HYDRAULIC VARIABLE SPEED GEAR</h3>

<p>Water is frequently used to take the place of
toothed gearing for the transmission of power,
particularly where it is desirable to vary speed. One
of the disadvantages of toothed gearing is that a
change of speed can only be made by shifting gears.
The speed cannot be varied gradually but is changed
by abrupt steps. The guns of a battleship must be
kept trained on the target, while the ship rolls in
the waves under them, so as to be ready for a broadside
at any instant. A telescope is secured to the
barrel of the gun and a man known as a “pointer”
tries to keep the cross-hairs of a telescope on the
target by constantly elevating or depressing the gun.
The speed of the elevating machinery must be constantly
changing; now running at high speed, the
next instant barely moving, and the next moment
reversing.</p>

<p>To produce these variations a hydraulic variable
speed gear is used. The construction is somewhat
complicated, but the general principle of operation
is simple. In a common pump water is lifted by
operating a plunger in and out of a cylinder. It
will be readily understood that the operation may be
reversed, and if power is applied to the water to
force it through the pump, it will make the plungers
move in and out of the cylinder. In the hydraulic
variable speed gear the driving shaft is made to
operate a set of little pumps which are connected
to a second series of pumps that act upon the driven
shaft. Instead of water oil is used, and the oil
pumped by the driving pumps is forced into the
driven pumps. The latter pumps are so connected
to the driven shaft as to cause it to rotate. But by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a simple mechanical expedient the stroke of the driving
pumps can be varied at will from maximum to
zero, and the motion of the pumps can also be reversed.
The variable amount of oil pumped into
the driven pumps varies the speed of the driven
shaft, for if it takes two strokes of a driving pump
to fill the cylinder of a driven pump the driven shaft
will travel at only half the speed of the driving
shaft.</p>

<p>In turbine-driven vessels some sort of gearing is
required between the propeller and the turbine. In
order to operate at its best efficiency a turbine must
run at very high speed, but this speed is entirely
too high for the propeller. There is a limit to the
rate at which a propeller may be driven. If this
limit is exceeded, the propeller merely bores a hole
in the water, forming a vacuum which produces a
drag on the ship. It is customary to interpose some
form of gearing between the propeller and the turbine
shaft, but because of the high speed and the
vast amount of power to be transmitted it is a difficult
matter to design gearing that will be reliable.
Furthermore, it is desirable to vary the speed of the
vessel and even to reverse it without slowing down
the turbine engine. In some cases a specially designed
system of toothed gearing has been employed,
in another the power of the turbine is
converted into electricity and then reconverted into
mechanical power by means of a motor on the
propeller shaft. This provides a very efficient transmission,
because the electricity can be very conveniently
controlled to accelerate, retard, or reverse
the speed of the propeller motor. The same thing
can also be done by using a hydraulic transmission
gear. This, although quite different from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
variable-speed gear, yet operates on the same general
principle. The turbine drives a centrifugal
pump and the water thus pumped is fed to a horizontal
water turbine on the propeller shaft. By an
ingenious arrangement of turbine wheels the speed
of the propeller shaft may be varied at will.</p>

<p>Hydraulic machinery is notable for its reliability.
Sometimes water or oil is used as a convenient
means of transmitting pressure from one part of a
machine to another. If we take a tube filled with
water and fit a plunger in each end, then, when one
plunger is depressed or pushed in, the other will be
expressed or pushed out. The pipe may be twisted
around in any direction or be tied up in a double
bowknot, and yet pressure applied to one cylinder
will immediately be felt by the other. This method
of transmission may do away with a vast number
of gears or levers.</p>

<p>Water is comparatively incompressible and hence
not a very adaptable means of transmitting power,
but a certain amount of flexibility is secured in
some systems by the use of what is termed an “accumulator.”
This consists of a large cylinder fitted
with a plunger. The plunger is heavily weighted
and it maintains a constant pressure upon the column
of water in the cylinder. If, for instance, a
hydraulic crane is being used and suddenly a larger
quantity of water is required than would normally
be delivered by a pump, it is automatically supplied
from the cylinder of the accumulator, and at a constant
pressure. The accumulator is arranged to control
the throttle valve of the steam pumping engine
so that when the plunger of the accumulator
reaches a predetermined height the stream is cut off
and the engine stops pumping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h3>TRANSMITTING POWER WITH SOUND WAVES</h3>

<p>During the war a new use of water for power
transmission was discovered and it is now being
developed for the operation of mining machinery.
The inventor of the new transmission is George Constantinesco,
a Rumanian engineer. His first application
of the invention was to a mechanism for
synchronizing the firing of a machine gun with the
rotation of an airplane propeller, so that it was
possible to fire through the propeller without danger
of striking its blades. There were several existing
methods of gearing the propeller to the machine
gun, but Constantinesco’s system proved so much
more reliable that it was adopted and widely used
by the British in their battle planes.</p>

<p>Instead of gears and levers, the Rumanian engineer
used a column of water in a heavy steel tube
to conduct impulses from the propeller to the
machine gun. The pulsations produced by the propeller
were too rapid to cause an actual displacement
of the whole column of water in the tube, but
a wave of pressure traveled through the water column
at an enormously high velocity.</p>

<p>We are wont to think of liquids as incompressible,
but they are actually slightly compressible and
highly elastic. This is demonstrated by the submarine
telephone or the submarine bell. Water, we
know, is an excellent medium for the transmission
of sound, but sound, we know, is produced by a succession
of pressure waves. If water were absolutely
incompressible, it could not convey sound
from one point to another. When sound travels
through a speaking tube the whole column of air
does not move back and forth simultaneously, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is divided into a series of waves. Each particle of
air has a local oscillatory motion which it communicates
to its neighbor, producing alternate compression
and rarefication, and it is this wave action
that travels through the column. The same is true
of water, except that the rate of travel of the pressure
wave in water is much higher than in air,
namely 4,800 feet per second. It is this wave transmission
that Constantinesco employed and which he
calls “sonic” wave transmission.</p>

<p>To-day sonic wave transmission is used to operate
rock drills. A wave generator is used, which acts
somewhat on the principle of a pump. A pair of
plungers are reciprocated at a rate of forty strokes
per second by means of an electric or gasoline motor,
and they produce a train of pressure waves in a
column of water. The water is contained in a
specially designed flexible steel piping which runs
to the rock drill. The pressure waves operate a
plunger in the drill and the plunger carries the drill
steel. The latter pounds the rock under the wave
impulses at the rate of forty strokes per second.</p>

<p>Sonic wave transmission is analogous to alternating
current transmission of electricity. There
are direct equivalents in the wave transmission, of
volts, amperes, frequency, angle of phase, induction,
inductance, capacity, resistance, condensers, transformers,
and single-phase or polyphase systems.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">AIR <i>VS.</i> WATER</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE STEAM engine had its origin in a kitchen; the
modern clock was first conceived in a cathedral;
our laws of motion were discovered under an apple
tree, but, strangest of all, pneumatic engineering
had its beginning in a <i>barber shop</i>. In each case it
was an inquisitive boy who played the leading rôle.</p>

<p>We do not hear much about the youthful father
of pneumatic engineering, possibly because he lived
so very long ago, but his story is fully as interesting
as that of Watt or Galileo or Newton. Young
Ctesibius dwelt in the city of Alexandria, Egypt,
250 years before the birth of Christ. His father
kept a barber shop, and the young lad used to watch
his father practice his tonsorial art on the Greek
and Egyptian dandies of the time. No doubt Ctesibius’s
father expected to make a first-rate barber of
his son, but history does not tell us much about his
early life.</p>

<p>The barbers of those days had their mirrors as
do the barbers of the present time. But a mirror in
those days was a treasured possession. It consisted
of a brightly polished plate of metal in which a person
could see himself “darkly” or it might have been
a plate of glass with a black backing. These mirrors
had to be carefully preserved from injury and
from moisture, and so, instead of having them
mounted on the wall as in a modern barber shop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
they were stowed carefully away and brought out
only after the tonsorial artist had completed his
operation and was ready to exhibit his finished
product to the customer.</p>

<h3>THE BOY WHO DISCOVERED COMPRESSED AIR</h3>

<p>Now in the tonsorial parlors of Ctesibius’s father
the precious mirror was suspended above the head
of the customer and when the barber had finished
the shave or haircut he pulled down the mirror and
let the customer survey his remodeled countenance.
After the customer viewed himself to his heart’s
content he merely released the mirror and it was
automatically drawn back into place by a counterweight
that slid in a case fastened to the wall.
Young Ctesibius noticed that every time the mirror
was released a curious whistling sound came from
the case in which the counterweight moved. No
doubt this phenomenon had been recurring day after
day for years, but it excited no more curiosity than
would a squeaky door, until, one day, the barber’s
son happened to notice it. Immediately he was all
curiosity. No one knew anything about air in those
days and the boy could get no satisfactory explanation
of the phenomenon, so he started an investigation
of his own. He found that the counterweight
fitted very closely in its case and when it dropped it
forced a stream of “wind” out of a crevice which
produced a whistling sound. That set Master
Ctesibius to thinking. He had discovered a method
of harnessing the wind. No more barber shop for
him; he was launched upon a career of scientific
research and invention.</p>

<p>The first use he made of his discovery was to build
a pipe organ which was driven by a water wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and hence was known as a water organ. But there
were other and more lucrative fields for the newly
discovered power. Being invisible, compressed air
proved a most valuable medium for performing
seemingly miraculous tricks with which the corrupt
priesthood of that time hoodwinked the public.
Naturally such air-controlled apparatus was kept
secret, and we have only a meager record of a few
of the ingenious devices used in the temples. However,
Ctesibius made many scientific discoveries
and became the most famous mathematician and
scientist of his age. We have read in Chapter IV of
his famous water clock adjusted to record hours of
varying length according to the season.</p>

<p>While Ctesibius is credited with being the first
man to make scientific use of compressed air, the
use of free air or wind as a power far antedates
him. Sailing vessels were probably in use long before
windmills were invented. As pointed out elsewhere,
windmills possessed an advantage over water
wheels in that they could be placed anywhere, instead
of being confined to the banks of streams.
They were widely used for pumping water, grinding
grain, and sawing wood until the steam engine
arrived and displaced them.</p>

<p>Although wind power is but little used to-day, air
is much more widely used in modern machinery than
is generally realized. A catalogue of the various
devices in which it plays a prominent part is likely
to prove astonishing. For instance, we employ it
to bore through rock, to stop the speeding express
train, and even to quell ocean billows. Being elastic
and compressible, it makes an ideal spring for the
storage of power and a cushion for absorbing
shocks. It is also used to fight back water and permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
men to work in the depths of the sea or in water-bearing
sand and earth.</p>

<p>Despite his extensive use of air Ctesibius knew
nothing of the atmospheric pressure. It was not
until the seventeenth century that atmospheric pressure
was discovered and measured. It was then
learned that there is no such thing as suction.</p>


<h3>RAISING WATER WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-124.jpg" width="250" height="350"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc250">FIG. 40.&mdash;SECTIONAL VIEW OF A
SUCTION PUMP</p>
</div></div>

<p>A suction pump should be called an atmospheric
pump. The operation of such a pump is illustrated
in Figure 40. A piston A slides in a cylinder B.
There is an opening in the bottom of the cylinder
which is normally closed by a clack valve C that
opens upwardly. There is a similar valve D in the
piston A. When the piston is pushed down it compresses
the air in the cylinder, closing the valve C
while valve D opens, permitting the air to escape.
Then on the upward stroke the valve D closes and
valve C opens permitting air to flow into the cylinder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
In this way the air in the pipe and cylinder
are exhausted after a few strokes. As the air is
rarefied and the pressure is reduced above the column
of water in the pipe the greater pressure of
the water outside the pipe forces the column to rise
until it eventually flows through the valve in the
piston and out of the spout of the pump. The maximum
height to which water can be raised by a suction
pump is thirty-four feet but in actual practice
the lift seldom exceeds twenty-six to twenty-eight
feet because the fit between the cylinder and piston
is not perfect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-125.jpg" width="400" height="384"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 41.&mdash;CONVENTIONALIZED SECTIONAL
VIEW OF A FORCE PUMP</p>
</div></div>

<p>When water is raised to a greater height a force
pump is used. Such a pump is shown in Figure 41.
The pump cylinder A has two valves B and C. The
valve B opens upwardly and valve C opens downwardly.
The piston D is a solid member containing
no valve. When the piston rises the valve C closes
and valve B opens, letting water into the cylinder.
On the reverse stroke the valve B closes and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
descending piston forces the water out through valve
C into pipe E. The height to which the water may
be lifted depends upon the power applied to the
piston and not upon atmospheric pressure. In a fire
pump two force pumps are used which alternately
deliver water into an air chamber. The air is compressed
by the water that enters the chamber and
exerts a steady pressure on the water, forcing it
out through the fire hose in a stream that is practically
steady.</p>

<p>It is a decided disadvantage to install a force
pump in a deep well because of the mechanical difficulty
of operating the piston at a great depth.
Often the suction and force pump principles are
combined. The force pump piston and cylinder are
located twenty-six and twenty-eight feet above the
level of the water in the well with a pipe leading
down into the water. The water is forced up into
the cylinder by exhausting the air in the cylinder
and pipe and then is forced out of the cylinder and
up a pipe to the top of the well. This also has its
disadvantages. In deep wells the pump piston must
still be located and operated at considerable depth.</p>

<h3>THE AIR LIFT</h3>

<p>A much more simple pump for deep wells is the
air lift in which there are no valves and no piston.
The pump consists of two pipes that are let down
into the water. (See Figure 42.) The larger pipe
is open at the top and bottom, and the smaller pipe
discharges air into the bottom of the larger one.
This air being directed upward has a lifting effect,
and mingling with the water in the pipe produces
a sort of froth which is so much lighter than solid
water that the atmospheric pressure on the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in the well is sufficient to raise the froth. The
water is thoroughly aerated and to a large extent
purified by this system of pumping, so that the air
lift commends itself particularly for city waterworks.
Sometimes a series of air lifts are used which lift
water by successive stages to a greater height than
would be possible with a single direct lift.</p>

<h3>EXCAVATING THROUGH QUICKSAND</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-128.jpg" width="400" height="419"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 43.&mdash;SECTIONAL VIEW OF A PNEUMATIC CAISSON</p>
</div></div>

<p>Centuries ago it was realized that it would be
possible for men to descend into the open sea
if they were protected by a bell-shaped chamber,
for the air trapped in the chamber would furnish
them with oxygen requisite for breathing purposes,
and would prevent the water from drowning them
out. This same idea of a diving bell is used on
land when sinking a shaft through quicksand or
water-bearing strata. A large box or caisson is
used. (See Figure 43.) This box may be either
cylindrical or rectangular, and it is open at the top
and bottom. The lower edges of the box are shod
with steel and form cutting edges that will sink
into the soil that is being excavated. At a height
of about seven feet above the bottom of the box
there is a transverse diaphragm known as the deck,
and the space below is known as the working chamber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
This deck is very strongly constructed, as it
has to support the weight of the concrete shaft
that is built above it. Laborers, commonly known
as “sand hogs,” enter the working chamber and dig
out a shallow pit in the floor of clay or sand. This
pit is then extended to the cutting edges of the
caisson. The caisson thus undermined settles down
into the excavation and another pit is started. In
this way, step by step, the caisson is sunk into the
ground. In order to overcome the friction of the
caisson against the sides of the excavation and to
insure its sinking, it is heavily weighted. When
water-bearing sand is reached, compressed air is
admitted into the working chamber to force the
water out. When the air pressure is greater than
the water pressure it drives the water out of the
sand in the working chamber, so that the men can
work in perfectly dry ground, even though the surrounding
sand may be so saturated with water as
to form a quicksand.</p>

<p>Of course the farther the excavation proceeds
below the water level the greater the air pressure
required, and the caisson would be blown up out
of the ground by this air pressure or would float
on the water were it not for the weights with which
it is loaded. When an open shaft is to be dug, pig
iron is loaded on the caisson to force it down, but
in most work the object is merely to sink a concrete
column down to rock and so the caisson is filled with
concrete above the deck. Sections are added to the
caisson as it sinks into the ground, and these sections
are filled with concrete. This method of building
the column facilitates the work of laying the
concrete, and at the same time provides the weight
necessary to overcome the buoyancy of the caisson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and the skin friction on the side walls of the
excavation.</p>

<p>After the caisson has been carried down to rock
and a good seat has been blasted out of solid rock,
the working chamber is completely filled with concrete
and the concrete shaft is thus anchored to the
rock.</p>

<h3>THE AIR LOCK</h3>

<p>Access to the working chamber is had through a
central shafting. In order to hold the air pressure
in the working chamber and yet provide for the
entrance of men and materials, an air lock is fitted
to the upper end of the shafting. This air lock, as
shown in Figure 43, consists of a chamber formed
with a trapdoor at the top and the bottom. Both
doors open downwardly. To enter the caisson, the
bottom door of the chamber must first be closed and
means are provided for doing this from outside the
air lock. The compressed air in the chamber is then
let out through a valve, and when the pressure
drops almost to normal the upper trapdoor falls
open of its own weight, giving access to the chamber.
After entering, the upper door is closed while
compressed air is admitted into the chamber; the
air pressure then serves to hold the upper trapdoor
closed. The bottom door, in the meantime, has been
kept closed by the air pressure below, which is
greater than that above the door. But after sufficient
air has been introduced into the chamber to
equalize the pressure on both sides of the lower trapdoor,
it falls open of its own weight. The occupants
of the chamber can then proceed down a ladder to
the working chamber. When leaving the caisson,
the action of the air lock is reversed. The bottom
door is pushed up and held closed for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
while air is released from the chamber, when the
greater pressure beneath will hold the door closed,
and after the pressure within the air lock has been
lowered practically to normal, the upper door drops
of its own weight, permitting the occupants of the
chamber to climb out. The same process must be
undergone by buckets loaded with sand or earth
from the excavation and by empty buckets returning
to the working chamber.</p>

<p>More time is required for a man to pass through
an air lock than for a load of sand or any inanimate
load. In some of the larger caissons a separate
small air lock is provided just for the use of the
workmen. In the air lock the pressure must be built
up slowly so that it will permeate a man’s whole
system. When we realize that the pressure that
men have to support in caisson work may amount to
from fifty to one hundred tons on the whole body,
it is difficult at first to understand why the body is
not flattened out like a pancake. It is only by permitting
the system to absorb the pressure so that
there is as much internal pressure as that outside
that a man is able to enter a compressed air chamber
without harmful results.</p>

<h3>THE CAISSON DISEASE</h3>

<p>Compression is rather annoying to a man who has
not experienced the sensation, but the principal
danger comes in decompression, particularly after a
person has been in the working chamber for a long
time. When breathing compressed air much larger
volumes of oxygen are taken into the lungs at each
breath than in the ordinary atmosphere, and one
feels decidedly exhilarated by this unusual supply of
stimulating oxygen. But with the oxygen large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
volumes of nitrogen are taken into the system as
well. The nitrogen permeates the blood while the
oxygen is consumed and exhaled in the form of carbon
dioxide. The longer a man is exposed to the
pressure the more nitrogen does he absorb. When
the pressure is released suddenly the nitrogen begins
to froth, just as a bottle of soda water does
when the stopper is removed. The nitrogen bubbles
in the small veins stop the circulation and produce
the dreaded “caisson disease” which makes itself
felt in the form of severe cramps and excruciating
pains. Not infrequently this disease ends in death.
By reducing the pressure gradually the nitrogen is
enabled to pass off completely without bubbling or
frothing, just as it is possible to let out the gas from
a soda bottle without frothing by permitting it to
escape through a pin hole in the stopper. The surest
cure for a victim of the caisson disease is to put
him immediately into what is known as a “hospital
tank” and build up the pressure in the tank equal
to that which he has just been subjected to in the
caisson, after which the air in the tank is let out so
slowly that there is plenty of time for the nitrogen
to pass off without forming bubbles.</p>

<p>A pressure of forty-five pounds per square inch
above that of the atmosphere is considered a severe
pressure for excavation work. But work has been
carried on in pressures up to fifty-two pounds,
corresponding to a depth of 120 feet below
water level.</p>

<p>Now that the cause of the caisson disease
is understood formulas have been worked out
to insure proper decompression. On one occasion
a diver descended 306 feet into the ocean
where the water pressure was 133 pounds on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
every square inch of his body. This meant that
the air which was pumped down to him had
to be compressed to the same pressure. The
diver actually remained at the bottom only a very
short time, but it took two hours and three-quarters
to bring him to the surface. He came up half the
distance very quickly and then had to rest on the
bottom rung of a Jacob’s ladder. The rungs on this
ladder were ten feet apart and he was instructed to
rest on each rung a certain specified time. When
he was ten feet below the surface he had to wait
three-quarters of an hour for the last trace of nitrogen
absorbed by his blood to pass off.</p>

<h3>BORING TUNNELS THROUGH RIVER BEDS</h3>

<p>It is comparatively simple to sink a vertical shaft
into water-bearing soil, but a horizontal shaft involves
serious difficulties. The action of a diving
bell is easily illustrated by inverting a tumbler and
pressing it down into a basin of water. The air
trapped in the tumbler will keep the upper part of
the glass dry, and by inserting a tube in the tumbler
it is possible to fill the tumbler so full of compressed
air as to drive out all the water. This is virtually
what is done in the caisson; but when excavating a
horizontal bore, the caisson must be turned on its
side. Turn the tumbler on its side and it is impossible
to keep the water out of it, no matter how much
air we may blow into it. The reason for this is that
the pressure on the open end of the tumbler is not
uniform. At the bottom, where the water is deeper,
it will be greater than at the top. If air is pumped
in to equalize the water pressure at the upper
edge of the glass, it will not prevent water from
flowing in at the bottom; and if it be equal to that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the bottom, the water pressure at the top cannot hold
the air in and keep it from pouring out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 44.&mdash;SECTIONAL VIEW OF A TUNNEL SHIELD</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fortunately most of the soil through which a subaqueous
tunnel is driven is not very fluid. It is
either sticky, as in clay, or sluggish enough to prevent
the water from flowing in rapidly. If there is
enough cover of silt or earth above the tunnel bore,
it will help to hold the air in the tunnel. When the
bore comes very close to the surface of the bed of
the stream that is being tunneled, loads of clay are
dumped along the line of the tunnel to provide the
requisite cover. In tunnel boring a shield is used
which is the equivalent of the caisson in vertical
boring. The shield is a cylindrical box with a
diaphragm across it corresponding to the deck
of the caisson. (See Figure 44.) In front of the
diaphragm there is a small working chamber which
is protected above by an extension of the shield
known as an apron. In the diaphragm there are a
number of doors at different levels, which may be
closed in case of danger. If work is proceeding near
the top of the shield, the upper doors are opened and
the pressure is regulated to equal the water pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
at that level. If the work is carried on near
the bottom of the shield, the upper doors are closed
and only the lower doors are open, and the pressure
is increased to equal the water pressure at that
point. Sometimes the material is of such a nature
that the men can safely pass out of the doors into
the working chamber outside, but more often it is
possible to work only within a limited area immediately
in front of the doors.</p>

<p>When the material is very soft it is often unnecessary
to do any actual excavation by hand in front
of the diaphragm. The shield is merely pushed forward
through the mud or silt and the doors are
opened to let the material flow in through them.
Workmen dig out this mud and it is hauled out of
the tunnel. Whenever bowlders are encountered it
is necessary for the men to work outside of the
diaphragm to chip away the rocks with compressed-air
drills, or else bore them and blast them with
small charges of dynamite.</p>

<p>In quicksand the material is so fluid that it is unsafe
to open the ordinary doors of the caisson, and
they are then provided with shutters which are
raised one at a time, to permit of operating on a
very small section of the head of the tunnel. After
enough material has been excavated from in front
of the shield, the latter is pushed forward and the
excavating is renewed.</p>

<p>Unlike caisson work, the weight of the shield is
of no assistance in making it penetrate the soil,
nor is it possible to move the entire lining of the
tunnel with the shield. The tunnel is lined with
rings of cast iron which are bolted together, the
rings themselves being made up of heavily ribbed
curved plates. The shield is formed with a “tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>”
which fits over the end of the tunnel line like a cap.
When the shield is to be pushed forward, a set of
hydraulic jacks are fitted between the end of the tunnel
lining and the diaphragm of the shield, and by
means of these the shield is given a shove forward
far enough for a new section of the cast-iron lining
to be added within the tail. The tunnel-lining rings
are usually sixteen inches wide so that it is customary
to move the shield ahead sixteen inches at a
time or just far enough for a new ring of lining to
be installed. Of course, the tunnel is fitted with air
locks by which men can enter the working section
without permitting the compressed air therein to
escape, and these locks are just like those used in
sinking a caisson, except that they are horizontal
instead of vertical.</p>

<h3>QUELLING OCEAN BILLOWS WITH AIR</h3>

<p>Air is also used in another and very novel way to
battle against water. In this case it is not quiet
water pressure, but the tremendous power of ocean
storms that is combatted.</p>

<p>The influence of a shoal upon ocean waves has
often been observed. A sand barrier even when
submerged to a depth of twenty or thirty feet will
break the waves of a heavy storm and leave an area
of comparatively quiet water behind it. The reason
for this is that the water in the waves does not
travel with the waves, but undergoes local oscillatory
motion. This motion is in the form of circular
or elliptical currents which travel in a vertical
plane. When a sand bar is encountered it interferes
with these local currents and breaks up the waves.</p>

<p>Knowing this to be the case, it occurred to Mr.
Philip Brasher that some other means of disturbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the rhythmic movement of the water might be
found, and he determined to try the experiment of
using compressed air for this purpose. Accordingly
he laid a perforated pipe under water and connected
it with an air compressor. Then when a
storm arose air was pumped into the pipe and it
rose in bubbles through the water. The effect of
this upward movement of air was instantly observable.
It upset the rhythmic water currents and
the waves which struck this wall of air bubbles
curled and broke as if they had encountered a shoal
of sand.</p>

<p>Several exposed piers on the Pacific coast have had
a pneumatic breakwater built around them so as to
protect them or ships lying alongside from being
pounded by the waves. There is no expense attached
to the breakwater except in time of storm
when the air pumps must be kept going. One important
advantage of the breakwater is that it does
not block navigation. A ship can sail right over the
wall of bubbles and find refuge behind it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">AIR SPRINGS AND CUSHIONS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">UNLIKE water, air is a highly compressible,
elastic fluid, and as such furnishes an excellent
medium for the storage of energy. It acts just like
a clock spring into which energy may be introduced
and stored by winding or compressing the spring.
The energy remains locked up in the spring and
when the spring is released, it gives back just as
much energy as was put into it, except for slight
frictional and heat losses. Air is a much better
spring than steel or any other metal because it never
loses its elasticity from fatigue and because it has
an enormous capacity for the storage of energy. It
possesses one serious drawback, however. Much of
the energy that is expended in compressing it is converted
into heat. If the air were to be used immediately
and without transmitting it to a distance,
there would be no advantage in extracting the heat,
but heat cannot be stored in air for long and it would
gradually escape from the storage reservoir or air
receiver and from the pipes leading the air to the
machines that it was to operate. As the heat escaped
it would lower the pressure of the air and hence
much of the energy would be lost.</p>

<h3>HEAT OF COMPRESSION</h3>

<p>In Chapter V we described a hydraulic system of
compressing air and noted that one of the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of this system is that it delivers air cooled to
the temperature of the water. This, of course, does
not mean that there is no loss due to heat. The air
bubbles as they are compressed are cooled by the
water that compresses them; in other words, the
heat of compression passes off into the water, making
the water warmer than it would otherwise be.
Heat is not produced without expenditure of energy
and a certain proportion of the water power is thus
wasted.</p>

<p>In most cases air is compressed by steam or electrically
driven compressors, and in such machines
the heat due to compression is a serious matter. The
air cylinders are water-jacketed to carry off the heat.
But air is a poor conductor; it acquires heat faster
than it can give it off to the water surrounding the
cylinders. In compound air compressors the air
compressed in one cylinder is cooled before being
passed on to the next cylinder, where it is further
compressed. The heat loss in compressing air in a
single stage up to 100 pounds gauge pressure is
about 30 per cent. Air that enters a compressor at
the normal pressure of the atmosphere and with an
initial temperature of 60 degrees F., if not cooled
will become heated to 415 pounds gauge pressure.
The higher the initial heat of the air, the greater the
rise of temperature. If a volume of air be subjected
to 294 pounds gauge pressure, it will occupy about
one-tenth of its former volume. If the air was introduced
into the compressor at zero, it would
acquire a temperature of about 650 degrees; if introduced
at 60 degrees, it would show an increase of
about 800 degrees; and, if started at 100 degrees,
it would show an increase of 900 degrees in passing
through the compressor. This shows the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of compressing the air in stages and cooling the
air between stages.</p>

<p>Sometimes the heat developed is sufficient to produce
a disastrous explosion. Air is noncombustible,
but the oils used to lubricate the compressor are
vaporized by the heat and when mixed with air form
a powerful explosive. Care has to be taken that
none but high-grade oil with a high flash point be
used in the compressor and that the temperature of
compression does not rise to near the flash point
lest the vaporized oil be ignited.</p>

<p>That fire can be produced by sudden compression
of air has long been known in the Philippine Islands.
The natives use a small air tube with a close-fitting
plunger. Combustible matter is placed in the bottom
of the tube, and on striking the plunger a sharp
blow this is ignited.</p>

<p>When compressed air is used in an air motor it
expands and in so doing absorbs heat. The more
rapidly it expands, the more heat it absorbs. This
heat it extracts from the motor and from the atmosphere
into which it escapes, and it is a common occurrence
to find a thick coating of frost around the
exhaust port. This is due to condensation of moisture
in the atmosphere or in the compressed air
itself, which, because of the rapid extraction of heat,
is converted into snow. On cold days enough frost
may be produced in the exhaust pipe to clog it and
interrupt the operation of the motor, and frost sometimes
clogs the air lines leading to the motor.</p>

<p>The fact that compressed air on expanding is
cooled, makes it an ideal power for use in mining
machinery. Steam is inconvenient because of the
difficulty of transmitting it to the machines without
loss of heat, because it would heat the machines so
that they cannot be handled readily and because the
exhaust steam would fill the mine with an impenetrable
fog; electricity is dangerous in mines that are
apt to contain explosive gases, because the wires are
liable to be broken and cause sparks by short circuiting,
and because sparks are likely to form between
the brushes and commutators of the motors;
but compressed air has none of these objections, and,
furthermore, the discharge from the machines furnishes
the operators with ample supplies of fresh
cool air which drives out disagreeable and dangerous
gases.</p>

<h3>AIR-DRIVEN HAMMERS</h3>

<p>The ordinary rock drill is really a pneumatic
hammer. The tool, which is chisel-shaped, is used
as a hammer to pound a hole in the rock. The tool
is driven up and down or in and out by compressed
air bearing alternately on opposite sides of a piston.
The elasticity of the compressed air acts as a cushion
to relieve the machine from shock. The drill is
mounted upon a tripod in such a way that it may
be operated in any direction.</p>

<p>The pneumatic riveter is another form of compressed-air
hammer. The machine is held in the
hands, and the tool, which is rapidly reciprocated by
air pressure, pounds the red-hot shank of a rivet.
While this is being done an assistant holds a hammer
against the head of the rivet. However, there
is a type of riveter which has a U-shaped frame.
One arm of the frame carries the reciprocating tool
while the other reaches around and bears against
the head of the rivet.</p>

<p>All sorts of tools have been built in which a small
air-driven motor furnishes the motive power. There
are hand drills in which the tool is revolved by a set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of pistons, shears for shearing sheep which operate
somewhat on the principle of hair clippers, and
pneumatic chisels used for chipping stone. Pneumatic
motors are widely used in operating cranes
and air hoists. They consist of a simple cylinder
and piston, and are used for short, direct lifts of
all sorts.</p>

<h3>STOPPING TRAINS WITH AIR</h3>

<p>Air has played a most important part in transportation.
When the air brake was first introduced
its purpose was to prevent collisions and provide
greater safety of operation. It was not generally
realized that efficient air brakes are not only a safety
precaution, but a means of increasing schedule
speeds. The more quickly a train can stop, the better
speed it may make, particularly on a schedule
that calls for frequent stops.</p>

<p>In the first air brake invented by George Westinghouse,
the locomotive was provided with a reservoir
in which air was stored and compressed by means of
a steam-operated air pump. The cars were each provided
with a cylinder and piston connected to the
air reservoir through a valve conveniently located
in the engineer’s cab. The piston of the air cylinder
was connected with the air brakes so that whenever
the engineer wished to stop his train he merely
turned on the compressed air and all the brakes in
the train were operated. This was a great saving
over the previous system of providing brakemen to
operate hand brakes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the problem of stopping a train
was not as simple as all this. On a long train the
cylinders near the engine were the first to receive
pressure sufficient to operate the brakes, and as a
result, the forward part of the train was retarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
more than the rear part at the start of the brake
operation, and the train came to a stop with a series
of jolts. Another serious disadvantage was the
fact that an enormous reservoir was required to furnish
all the air necessary for a long train. But the
most serious drawback was the fact that occasionally
a train broke apart and then the engineer was
powerless to control the brakes of the detached portion
of the train. If the accident occurred on a down
grade, there would result a collision between the
cars running by their own momentum and gravity
and those attached to the engine. This led to the
present system of reversing the process which consists
in keeping air pressure constantly in the train
pipe and setting the brakes by relieving the pressure
in the train pipe.</p>

<p>Each car is provided with its own cylinder which
furnishes the necessary air for the operation of its
brakes. There is, of course, a main cylinder on the
locomotive in which air is pumped at high pressure
by a steam-operated pump. When the pressure of the
main reservoir falls below a predetermined amount,
the air pump starts operating automatically and
continues until the requisite pressure is restored.
Air from the reservoir is fed to the train pipe at a
certain pressure and feeds the local reservoirs on
the cars of the train. At each car it passes through
a very ingenious triple valve, which consists of a
cylinder with a double piston, one operated by pressure
in the train pipe, and the other by pressure in
the local cylinder. The piston operated by the pressure
of the train pipe is larger than the other and
consequently the valve piston is normally pressed
back, uncovering a small port through which air
from the train pipe feeds into the local reservoir. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
this way the air in each local reservoir is maintained
at the same pressure as that of the train pipe.
Whenever air is let out of the train pipe, the piston
is pushed out by the excess pressure on the local
reservoir side and uncovers another port which permits
air to flow from the local reservoir to the brake
cylinder operating the brakes. The advantage of
this system is that each car is always supplied with
sufficient power to act on the brakes immediately
without having to draw its supply of air from the
main reservoir. In case the train breaks apart, the
air in the train pipe escapes and the brakes are set
automatically.</p>

<p>There have been a number of improvements in air
brakes aimed to make the operation of the brakes
more uniform and to insure immediate action, even
on a very long train. Modern express trains weighing
920 tons and traveling at a velocity of 60 miles
per hour, can be brought to a standstill in 860 feet,
or practically their own length. Automatic arrangements
are provided to insure the application of the
brakes at graduated rate, except, of course, when
the emergency brakes are applied. As the speed of
the train slows down the pressure is gradually relieved,
otherwise the train would stop with a severe
jolt. The rate of applying the brakes so as to provide
a smooth retardation depends in large measure
upon the weight of the train.</p>

<p>On the New York subways, it is interesting to
note, every passenger who boards a train has his
weight recorded by the brake mechanism, and allowance
is automatically made for the inertia that his
mass adds to the train when it is in motion. The
weight operates through a system of levers to control
the amount of pressure that is applied to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
brakes so that when the engineer operates the brake
lever, he does not have to consider whether the cars
are light or jammed full of passengers; the brake
mechanism itself takes care of this.</p>

<h3>PROPELLING CARS WITH AIR</h3>

<p>If air can be used to stop a train, why cannot air
be used to propel it? This question occurred to
many inventors and they answered it by building
air-propelled cars and locomotives. Pneumatic cars
were tried out on street railways, but they have had
to give way to electric cars which do not need to
carry their power around with them, but can draw
it from a central power plant through a trolley wire.
In only a few situations, such as in mines where
electric sparking is feared, are air-propelled cars
and locomotives still used to any considerable extent.</p>

<p>However, air plays another and highly important
part in transportation and here it is employed not
to deliver energy stored in it, but to serve as a
cushion. Without the soft, flexible grip of the air-filled
rubber tubes with which automobile wheels are
shod, high-speed motoring would be practically impossible.
There is nothing that can compare with
air for absorbing shocks and unevennesses in the
road. Whenever an obstruction is encountered, not
only is the shock absorbed by elasticity of the air,
but the impact is immediately distributed uniformly
over the whole tire, so that the strain on the tire is
not localized and the life of the tire is correspondingly
increased. There have been many attempts to
introduce substitutes for pneumatic tires, such as
combinations of metallic springs and straps, but
these have failed, chiefly for the reason that they
cannot distribute the shock as the pneumatic tire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
does. Consequently they are not only liable to damage,
but they do not absorb the obstructions as readily
as the pneumatic tire does and the vehicle which
they carry is subjected to heavy stresses and strains.</p>

<p>Air as a cushion is used to prevent the rebound of
the springs of an automobile and is also widely employed
in machinery to absorb the momentum of
moving parts or to slow the action of a spring. In
a door check, for instance, a powerful spring is
provided which would slam the door shut were it not
for the cushioning action of air. A plunger is connected
to the door and slides in a cylinder on the
door frame. The air compressed by the plunger
can escape only very slowly through a small port.</p>

<h3>AIR CUSHIONS FOR ELEVATORS</h3>

<p>Air cushions are used in elevators to prevent too
rapid a fall of the car in case of accident. The
lower part of the elevator shaft is completely inclosed
and fitted with steel doors to form an air
pocket. The car fits the shaft closely enough to compress
the air under it when it is moving downward.
At normal speeds, this air escapes quite readily
around the sides of the car and through cracks in
the doors, but when the speed is excessive the air
cannot escape fast enough and sufficient pressure is
built up to retard the car so that it will strike the
bottom with a moderate impact not at all dangerous
to the passengers.</p>

<p>In the Woolworth Building, New York, the highest
elevator shafts are 680 feet high and the air pockets
are 137 feet deep&mdash;i. e., they reach up to the tenth
story. If the car broke away from its supports at
the top of the shaft it would be traveling at the rate
of 132 miles an hour when it struck the air pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
but before it reached the bottom the air would bring
it practically to a stop. Imagine a heavy automobile
traveling at 132 miles per hour and brought down
to a standstill in half a city block! The passengers
would be hurled out of their seats, but in an elevator
the passengers are standing and can brace themselves
against the pressure produced by their own
momentum. The velocity acquired in falling 543
feet to the air pocket must be overcome in 137 feet
or ¼ of the distance. This means that the weight
of each passenger is multiplied by four. A man
who weighed 150 pounds would find that his pressure
on the floor of the car had mounted to 600
pounds. One of the inventors of the pneumatic
cushion for elevators was killed when testing out
a car, not because of the impact of the car, but because
he was foolish enough to sit in a chair. The
chair gave way under his suddenly acquired weight
and the poor man was fatally stabbed by one of the
splinters.</p>

<p>Air jets are used for a variety of purposes ranging
from tamping railway tracks to painting buildings.
When a track is depressed under the tamping
action of trains passing over it the ties must be
raised and new ballast introduced under them so as
to bring them up to level. In order to save hand
labor and insure the perfect filling of all cavities a
pneumatic tamper is sometimes used. The ballast,
consisting of sand or gravel up to ¾ inch in diameter,
is fed out of a hopper and meets a blast of air
that hurls it into place like shot from an air rifle.
This furnishes a very solid and compact road bed.</p>

<p>It is in much the same way that weather-stained
stone walls are cleansed by means of a sand blast.
The sand particles projected by the jet of air act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
like myriads of tiny bullets which chip away the face
of the stone.</p>

<h3>LAYING CEMENT WITH AN AIRGUN</h3>

<p>It is after this same fashion that the cement gun
is used to project cement against wire reenforcement
to form walls of buildings. Carl E. Akeley
was led to the invention of the cement gun by his
efforts to find an expeditious and economical method
of mounting specimens of large animals for the
Field Museum in Chicago. He constructed a pneumatic
device for spraying cement and water upon a
canvas-covered framework, thus building up a body
upon which the skin of the animal could be mounted.
This machine was improved and tried out successfully,
on a large scale, in constructing buildings.</p>

<p>The machine as now constructed consists of a
hopper into which a proper mix of sand and cement
is introduced. Compressed air blows this mixture
out of a nozzle. Here it meets a jet of water also
propelled by compressed air. The water, sand, and
cement combine and strike the wall or surface to be
coated with such an impact as to make a compact
fine-grained coating known to the trade as “gunite.”</p>

<p>Large surfaces can be painted much more readily
and more evenly with compressed air than with a
brush. A widely spreading air jet is used which
draws the paint out of a receptacle, breaking it up
into minute droplets that are projected as a mist
against the surface, covering it with a uniform
coating.</p>

<h3>AIR AS A TENSION SPRING</h3>

<p>So far we have been considering air as a compression
spring. It may also be employed in a manner
somewhat analogous to a tension spring. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
air is exhausted from a receptacle we have a partial
vacuum which will produce work, but in the opposite
direction from that produced by compressed air.
Of course there is no such thing as suction, and it
is the pressure of the atmosphere which is employed
to do the work.</p>

<p>We are apt to overlook the fact that a vacuum
cleaner depends upon atmospheric pressure to drag
the dust and dirt out of a carpet. A vacuum cleaner
would not work on the moon, where there is no
atmospheric pressure. The apparatus consists of
an air pump, usually driven by an electric motor,
which exhausts, or partially exhausts, the air from
a foot piece that is dragged along the carpet. As
the air under atmospheric pressure rushes in
through the carpet to take the place of the air that
has been pumped out, it carries with it all loose
particles of dirt. The dirt is filtered out of the air
or a mechanical trap is provided to catch and retain
the dirt while the air is allowed to escape.
Large-scale vacuum cleaners are used for cleaning
city streets. The dirt is loosened by revolving
brushes and is then drawn up by atmospheric
pressure into a tank.</p>

<p>Another use of atmospheric pressure is to be
found in the pneumatic tubes which convey mail
from one post office to another. Air is exhausted
from the tube and when a carrier is inserted which
fits the tube closely the atmospheric pressure behind
it forces the carrier along to its destination. The
same system is used to carry money to and from the
cashier’s office in department stores.</p>

<p>In later developments of the pneumatic mail carrier
compressed air was used back of the carrier,
but the principle of operation was not altered. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
either case propulsion is effected by the difference of
air pressure on the opposite sides of the car.</p>

<p>In 1869 Alfred E. Beach built an experimental
subway line under Broadway, New York, near
Warren Street. The line was only 200 feet long. A
cylindrical car large enough to hold eighteen people,
fitted the bore snugly and was propelled in one direction
by compressing the air in the tunnel and in the
other direction by exhausting the air.</p>

<p class="pch">POWER FROM HEAT</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE TERM “water power” is a misnomer. There
is no power inherent in water. It is gravity that
makes water fall in cataracts or flow down a river
bed, and hence it is the force of gravity that is
responsible for the turning of our turbines and
Pelton wheels. Water is merely the medium through
which the force of gravity acts.</p>

<p>In the steam engine, water, again, serves as a
medium and it is the energy of heat that is actually
the working force. A closed vessel is partly filled
with water and heat is applied to it. The water
grows hotter and hotter until at a temperature of
212 degrees it begins to vaporize. The temperature
of the water remains stationary until the space above
the water is completely filled with steam at a pressure
equal to that of normal air pressure. The steam
gauge then registers zero. Continued application of
heat raises the pressure of the steam and also raises
the temperature of the water. When the steam
gauge shows a pressure of 25 pounds per square
inch, the water temperature is nearly 267 degrees;
at 100 pounds it is over 337 degrees; at 200 pounds it
is 387 degrees; at 500 pounds it is about 467 degrees.
As steam is drawn off from the boiler a proportionate
amount of water turns immediately into steam to
take its place. If the boiler should burst, the entire
mass of water would instantly flash into steam because
its temperature is far above the boiling point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
at normal air pressure. That is why the explosion
of a steam boiler is so violent. If the boiler were
entirely filled with steam the effect of an explosion
would not begin to be so destructive as if the boiler
were half full of water. It is really the explosion of
water that does such serious damage.</p>

<p>When the steam pressure in a boiler corresponds
to the temperature of the water it is said to be
<i>saturated</i>. The water in a boiler boils violently
when the steam is drawn off rapidly and tiny droplets
of water are carried off in the steam, producing
what is known as <i>wet steam</i>. Steam that
carries no water particles in suspension is called
<i>dry steam</i>. When the steam is heated above the temperature
of the water by means of an auxiliary heating
device or by some peculiar construction of the
boiler, it is called <i>superheated steam</i>.</p>

<p>In order to economize fuel it is highly important
that as much water surface be exposed to the heat
as possible. This may be done either by passing the
heat in tubes through the water or by passing the
water in tubes through the fire. Locomotive boilers
are of the fire-tube type. The flaming gases of the
furnace pass through the boiler through a series of
tubes that lead to the stack. In the water-tube boilers
it is highly important that a good and rapid circulation
of water be maintained, otherwise there
might be local generation of steam with serious
consequences.</p>

<h3>THE GIFFARD INJECTOR</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 45.&mdash;INJECTOR FOR INTRODUCING WATER INTO A
STEAM BOILER</p>
</div></div>

<p>As steam is used from a boiler the water is slowly
exhausted and it must be replenished with a fresh
supply. In early days of the steam engine, water
was pumped in against the boiler pressure by the
use of powerful pumps, but in 1858 a man named
Giffard invented a most ingenious apparatus by
which steam of the boiler was used to force water
in directly against its own pressure. This seems
like lifting oneself by one’s boot straps. When the
injector was first invented it seemed so impossible
for it to work that engineers would not accept it until
it had repeatedly demonstrated its operativeness.
Even after it was accepted and in common use its
mysterious operation was a subject of discussion
for years. A sectional view of a Giffard injector is
shown in Figure 45. Steam from the boiler comes
down the tube A and passes out in a jet from the
nozzle B. A needle valve C may be moved into the
nozzle to reduce or shut off the jet of steam. The
jet enters a conical chamber D which has a tube E
that runs down into the water reservoir. The steam
jet blows the air out of chamber D, producing a
partial vacuum which draws water up the tube E
and into the chamber D. When the water reaches
the steam jet it is driven out of the chamber across
a short open space into a slightly diverging tube or
receiving cone F and through a check valve G into
the boiler. At H there is a glass window through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
which the action of the water jet as it rushes into
the receiving tube may be watched. I is an overflow
pipe leading back to the reservoir. When the
steam flows into the cone B it gathers momentum
and issues from the nozzle in a jet of high velocity.
On striking the water it combines with the water
and condenses, but at the same time it imparts its
momentum to the water so that the water is given
more than enough momentum to drive it into the
boiler against the pressure in the boiler.</p>

<p>The pressure of steam is utilized to drive the piston
of an engine or the steam may be set in motion by
letting it issue from a nozzle, when its momentum
may be employed to drive a steam turbine in the
same way that a water jet drives a Pelton wheel
but in either case it is heat that does the work. The
steam expands as it moves the piston and as it passes
through the nozzle its expansion is accompanied by
a corresponding loss of heat.</p>

<p>As we have already noted, it was for the purpose
of raising water that inanimate powers were first
set to work. It was with the same object in view
that steam was first employed.</p>

<h3>HERO’S STEAM ENGINE</h3>

<p>To be sure the first steam engine was invented by
Hero, the disciple of Ctesibius, in the second century
before Christ, and it was not a water-raising
machine. It consisted of a hollow sphere (see Figure
46), mounted to rotate and fed with steam that
entered it through the journals. The steam issued
from opposite sides of the sphere through two bent
tubes. The steam in issuing from the tubes reacted
against the tubes, pushing them back and causing
the sphere to revolve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Every action is accompanied by an equal and
opposite reaction. A bullet fired from a gun kicks
the gun back. In order to push the bullet out of the
barrel, the powder must have something to push
against and the push against the gun is equal to the
push against the bullet. Even if there were no bullet
to be pushed the discharge of the powder would
react against the gun. In order to push its own
gases out of the gun, the powder must push back
against the gun.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-157.jpg" width="400" height="371"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 46.&mdash;HERO’S STEAM ENGINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Hero’s engine, the steam, in order to push itself
out of the sphere, must push against the bent tubes.
We have a similar reaction motor in the revolving
lawn sprinkler. The water issuing from the bent
arms of the sprinkler forces them back and causes
them to revolve. Were the arms radial and not bent
the reaction would be there just the same, but it
would be exerted against the center of the wheel
and hence there would be no rotation.</p>

<p>Reaction has nothing to do with the pressure of
the atmosphere as so many people imagine. A gun
would kick just as hard and the lawn sprinkler or
Hero’s engine would operate just as well and as fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in a perfect vacuum. It was to demonstrate the
principle of reaction that Hero built his steam engine.
As far as we know it was never put to useful
work and remained merely a scientific toy.</p>

<h3>NEWCOMEN’S ATMOSPHERIC ENGINE</h3>

<p>The first practical use of steam power was applied
to the pumping of water from the deep mines of
Cornwall. Newcomen’s engine, which antedated
Watt’s by several decades, was known as an atmospheric
engine. It consisted of a cylinder fitted with
a piston, but the top of the cylinder was open. The
piston was connected to one end of a lever or walking
beam, the other end of which was connected by
a chain with the plunger of a pump situated at the
bottom of the mine shaft. Little power was required
to lift the piston because it was counterbalanced by
the chain and plunger attached to the opposite end
of the walking beam. The real work was done in
pushing the piston down and thereby raising the
pump plunger. Steam under low pressure was let
into the cylinder under the piston to raise it and
then a jet of water was sprayed into the steam-filled
cylinder. This condensed the steam, producing
vacuum and the atmospheric pressure acting
on the upper surface of the piston forced the piston
down, raising the pump plunger. The engine ran
very slowly, making only about 15 strokes per
minute. Later it was improved, producing about
30 strokes per minute.</p>

<h3>WATT’S STEAM ENGINE</h3>

<p>Watt was the first man to build an engine in which
the real work was done by the pressure of steam as
in modern steam engines. As long as the steam engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was used for pumping water the reciprocating
piston could be connected directly to the pump
plunger and it was unnecessary to exert power on
both sides of the piston, but in 1782 Watt obtained
a patent on a double-acting engine. Steam was admitted
first on one side of the piston and then on the
other. The walking beam was connected by means
of a connecting rod to a crank on a shaft that carried
a flywheel, and the seesaw motion of the beam was
converted into rotary motion of the wheel. This
opened up new industrial opportunities for the
steam engine.</p>

<p>The steam was exhausted from the cylinder into
a condenser, i.e., a chamber, in which a spray of
water converted the steam into water, producing
a vacuum, thereby relieving the piston of back
pressure and virtually adding that much more
power to the steam operating on the opposite side
of the piston. A pump driven by the engine drew
the water and the air liberated from the condensed
steam out of the condenser.</p>

<p>Watt invented an ingenious governor to control
the flow of steam to the engine and insure a uniform
motion. (See Figure 47.) This governor consisted
of a pair of levers hinged to a revolving shaft and
each provided with a ball weight at its free end. The
shaft was revolved by the engine and if the engine
tended to run too fast the balls were thrown out by
centrifugal action. In so doing they operated a
throttle valve cutting down the steam supply. When
the engine slowed down the balls would drop, admitting
more steam. In this way the speed of the
engine was kept within close limits. The ball governor
in improved form is still widely used in
stationary engines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h3>USING THE HEAT IN THE STEAM</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-160.jpg" width="400" height="470"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 47.&mdash;WATT’S BALL GOVERNOR</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another of Watt’s inventions which has proved of
highest importance in steam engineering was the
cut off. In his first engine the piston was subjected
to the full boiler pressure throughout its stroke, and
the steam that poured out of the exhaust port of the
cylinder at the end of the piston stroke was almost
as hot as that which entered the cylinder at the beginning
of the stroke. The heat that goes out in the
exhaust represents just so much wasted energy.
Watt realized this and so he invented a valve which
would cut off the flow from the boiler before the
piston had completed its stroke. Then the steam
back of the piston would continue to expand because
of the heat within it and would keep on pushing the
piston. Of course, the pressure would gradually
diminish and there would be less power in the
stroke than if the full boiler pressure were pushing
the piston all the way, but this loss of power is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
offset by the saving in steam and in the fuel used to
heat the steam. The point at which the cut-off
takes place depends largely upon the pressure of
the steam. If the steam is cut off when the piston
has made only one-fifth of its stroke, one-fifth
as much steam will be used at each stroke as
would be the case if the steam were used nonexpansively.
However, in actual practice the
expansion of the cut-off steam instead of being
five times would be only about four times,
because of the clearance that must be allowed
between the piston and the end of the cylinder. If
steam of 100 pounds absolute pressure is used, the
average pressure throughout the piston will be only
about 57 per cent of the full pressure of the steam
in the boiler, but each pound of steam will actually
do .57 × 4 = 2.28 times as much work as it would if
used nonexpansively. All sorts of valve gear have
been invented to admit steam quickly and cut it off at
the proper point to produce the most efficient result.</p>

<p>In low-pressure cylinders in order to prevent loss
of heat through the wall of the cylinder, the latter
is steam-jacketed. In other words, there is an outer
casing surrounding the cylinder and between this
casing and the cylinder steam is admitted to keep
the cylinder walls hot.</p>

<p>In order to make full use of the heat in steam it
is, in some engines, sent through a series of two,
three, and even four cylinders. The exhaust from
one cylinder goes into a second larger cylinder.
From here after doing work on a piston it discharges
into a third still larger cylinder and from that may be
led into a fourth cylinder. The cylinders must be
progressively larger to allow for the expansion of the
steam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The ordinary steam engine labors under the disadvantage
of having to start and stop its pistons at the
end of each stroke. Every body possesses inertia,
whether it be moving or at rest. If it be at rest, it
takes much more energy to set it in motion than to
keep it moving. In fact it would keep on moving
without further expenditure of energy were there
no friction and no forces acting against it. In
order to stop the body energy must be expended to
overcome its inertia. The more rapidly a body is
started and the more quickly it is stopped, the more
work must be done in overcoming its inertia. In a
steam engine not only the piston but other parts
connected to it may be required to reciprocate several
hundred times per minute. A great deal of
energy is uselessly expended in starting and stopping
these parts.</p>

<p>Many efforts have been made to produce a rotary
engine in which the piston rotates instead of reciprocating,
thus doing away with the work of overcoming
inertia. However, there are serious obstacles
to the construction of such an engine, and as yet no
truly efficient and practical rotary engine has been
built.</p>

<h3>DE LAVAL’S STEAM TURBINE</h3>

<p>However, there is another type of engine in which
the steam is applied continuously and all the parts
revolve. Such an engine was the reaction turbine
invented by Hero, to which reference has already
been made. Modern turbines, however, are of very
different construction. They resemble the Pelton
wheels and turbines used in developing water power,
differing from them mainly in the fact that use is
made of the expansive energy of steam which is
lacking in water. In the De Laval steam turbine a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
wheel is used which has a series of curved buckets
all around its periphery that are closed at the outer
end by a circular rim. (See Figure 48.) Steam is
directed against this bucket, not tangentially as in
a Pelton wheel, but from the side. Several steam
nozzles are employed and as the steam jets strike
the buckets and sweep around their curved surfaces
they react against the buckets and drive the wheel
around. In order to operate efficiently the velocity
of the steam must be very high and the wheel must
also turn at high speed. When steam flows through
a diverging nozzle its velocity is greatly accelerated
by its expansive effort. Such nozzles are used in the
De Laval turbines and the steam issues from them
with a velocity which may be higher than that of a
rifle bullet. The buckets are forged and the hard-scale
surface is left on them; otherwise they would
wear away quickly under the action of the powerful
jets of steam.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-163.jpg" width="400" height="334"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 48.&mdash;THE DE LAVAL STEAM TURBINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>The turbine wheel may revolve at a speed of
30,000 revolutions per minute. Such a tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
speed has its disadvantages. If a wheel is to run
smoothly it must revolve on its center of gravity.
A lopsided wheel, or one that is mounted a little off
center, produces a pounding action which imposes
a serious strain upon the bearings and the revolving
parts. The wheel tries to turn on its own center of
gravity and will do so if permitted to. It is impossible
to balance a wheel so perfectly that the axis it
turns on passes exactly through its center of gravity.
At ordinary speeds this slight eccentricity is so
slight that it is practically negligible, but when we
have to deal with 30,000 revolutions per minute the
least divergence between the center of rotation and
the center of gravity will produce dangerous strains.
For this reason the wheel of the De Laval turbine
is mounted on a flexible shaft and on floating bearings,
so that it will automatically find and turn on
its own center of gravity. In order to utilize the
power developed in the wheel, gearing must be
used to step down the speed.</p>

<h3>PARSONS EXPANSION TURBINE</h3>

<p>The Parsons steam turbine resembles a water turbine
in its action. Instead of having a few nozzles
directing steam against the buckets there is a nozzle
for each bucket, and instead of a single wheel there
is a series of them through which the steam passes,
successively passing through a set of nozzles between
each wheel. The nozzles are formed of blades
on the periphery of stationary wheels. These blades
are curved in the opposite direction to the blades on
the revolving wheels, as shown in Figure 49. Steam
in passing through the ring of curved stationary
blades is divided up into a series of jets which strike
the curved blades of the first wheel. In passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
through this wheel the direction of the stream is reversed,
and it enters between the second set of stationary
blades, which turn it back again and direct
it against the next wheel. Thus the steam pursues
a sinuous course through the series of wheels. To
allow for the expansion of the steam the blades are
made progressively longer and the wheels of progressively
larger diameter from the inlet to the exhaust
end of the engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 49.&mdash;PERIPHERAL VIEW OF THE BLADES OF A
PARSONS TURBINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Curtis turbine combines the De Laval and the
Parsons principles. The steam enters through a
series of nozzles which are of the expanding type,
then it goes through a series of moving and stationary
blades, as in the Parsons turbine, from which
it enters another set of expanding nozzles and gains
velocity and momentum before passing through the
second series or stage of moving and fixed blades.
(See Figure 50.)</p>

<p>Steam turbines are particularly adapted for use
in electric power plants. The speed of rotation of
the Parsons and Curtis types is much lower than
that of the De Laval and hence the electric generators
may be directly driven by them without the
interposition of any gearing. They can be built of
larger power than the reciprocating engines because
they are so economical of space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

OF A CURTIS TURBINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>A good comparison of turbine versus reciprocating
engines is offered by the 74th Street power station
of the Manhattan Elevated Railway, New York.
This station, which was completed in 1901, was
equipped with eight huge reciprocating engines,
each developing 8,000 horsepower normally, and
capable of delivering a maximum of 12,500 horsepower.
The whole plant, therefore, had a maximum
capacity of 100,000 horsepower. Gradually these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
units have been giving way to steam turbines of
much higher power, and in 1919 there was installed
one powerful turbine which alone was capable of
developing as much power as the entire plant of
1901. This is a triple-compound turbine comprising
one high-pressure turbine and a low-pressure turbine
at each side. Steam enters the high-pressure
turbine at 205 pounds pressure to the square inch
and then exhausts into the low-pressure turbines,
passing from them into condensers which operate
under 29 inches vacuum. Each turbine drives a
separate generator and the combined horsepower
of the whole unit is about 100,000, while the floor
space occupied is only 50 by 52 feet.</p>

<p>The economy of space and of fuel offered by the
steam turbine is of great value in the power plants
of ships, and this form of prime mover has been
installed on modern high-speed passenger liners and
also on high-speed war vessels. While in certain
respects the turbine is ideal for such service, there
are two handicaps which must be overcome. In the
first place, the most efficient speed for the turbine
is considerably higher than the efficient speed of the
propeller and some means must be provided for stepping
down the speed. In the second place, the turbine
cannot be as economically controlled as a reciprocating
engine and its direction of rotation cannot
be reversed, so that difficulties are encountered in
maneuvering the ship in harbors. It is no simple
matter to gear down the high speed and enormous
power of a turbine, However, an elaborate system
of gearing has been provided for this purpose
which has proved satisfactory even in powerful
battle cruisers. The British battle cruisers with a
power plant of 134,000 horsepower are driven by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
geared turbines. To reverse the propellers separate
low-power turbines are used.</p>

<p>A more attractive system of control is to have the
turbines drive electric generators and then use the
electric power to drive the propellers through motors
mounted on the propeller shafts. The electric
power can easily be controlled from the bridge
and the propellers may be reversed by reversing
the motors. However, the disadvantage of the
electric system is that it occupies a great deal of
space, particularly in plants running over 100,000
horsepower.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pch">BURNING FUEL IN THE ENGINE CYLINDER</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">ONE OF the handicaps of steam power is that the
heat produced by the combustion of fuel is not
used directly to drive the piston. A large part of
the heat energy in coal goes up the chimney or is
wasted by radiation from the furnace walls. With
anthracite coal in the furnace the loss may be as low
as 22 per cent in the very best types of boilers. In
the engine other serious losses occur, so that in
the best condensing reciprocating steam engines the
power delivered is only 10 to 16 per cent of that
stored in the fuel. In locomotives the efficiency is
as low as 4 to 6 per cent. In turbines the steam is
used to better advantage and the actual power delivered
may run up to 20 per cent of that in the fuel.</p>

<p>In internal-combustion engines the furnace and
boiler losses are largely overcome by burning the
fuel right in the cylinder, where the heat energy of
the combustion may be utilized directly upon the
piston. There are other losses, however, so that the
most efficient gasoline engines deliver only 28 per
cent of the energy in the fuel, and coal-gas engines
may run up to 31 per cent.</p>

<p>A wide range of fuels may be used in an internal-combustion
engine. They may be either gaseous,
liquid, or even solid. In stationary engines hydrogen,
coal gas, natural gas, blast-furnace gas, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
producer gas are employed to advantage. Volatile
fuels, such as alcohol, bensol, gasoline, and kerosene,
are turned into a mist or vapor and then burned
as a gas. In engines of the Diesel type any liquid
fuel ranging down to thick crude oils may be employed,
and in one type of engine, which, however,
has not proved commercially practicable, coal dust
is burned in the cylinder.</p>

<h3>BURNING AIR IN THE AUTOMOBILE ENGINE</h3>

<p>Owing to the widespread use of automobiles, the
general public is better acquainted with internal-combustion
engines than with steam engines. Nevertheless,
there are many elementary facts in connection
with gasoline engines that are not generally
known. The average motorist probably does not
realize that he burns far more air in his motor than
gasoline, and he probably does not understand why
it is that the mixture of gasoline vapor and air must
be compressed before it is ignited, or why only one
out of four strokes of the piston is a power stroke.</p>

<p>If a volume of gasoline vapor be thoroughly mixed
with an equal volume of air, the mixture will not
explode. Only when there is an excess of air will
combustion take place, and the most intensive explosion
takes place when there are nine parts of
air to one part of gasoline vapor. Where gasoline
is vaporized in a carburetor the best mixture is one
part of gasoline-saturated air to eight parts of pure
air. Hence it is mainly air that is burned in an
automobile engine.</p>

<p>The energy of combustion is much greater when
the mixture is compressed. The particles of gasoline
and air are forced into more intimate contact by
the compression. The same thing is true of gunpowder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
If gunpowder is ignited in the open air,
it will burn quickly, but not with explosive violence.
If, on the other hand, the powder is compressed in
a cartridge and is then ignited, an explosion takes
place. Nearly twice as much gas was required in
the early noncompression-type motors as is required
to-day in the compression motors of the same power.</p>

<p>In an internal-combustion engine the cylinder
serves as a furnace. This “furnace” must be
charged with fuel, and after the fuel has been
burned the “ashes”&mdash;i. e., the products of combustion&mdash;must
be removed. The piston serves as the
furnace stoker.</p>

<p>In the ordinary four-cycle engine the action of
the piston is as follows: On the first or down stroke
of the piston a mixture of air and gasoline vapor
is drawn into the cylinder; on the next or rising
stroke the charge is compressed. Then the charge
is ignited by an electric spark, and the rapid combustion
of the charge produces gases which drive
the piston down. On the fourth stroke the piston
rises again and pushes the burnt gases out of the
cylinder. The piston receives energy intermittently,
or only once out of four strokes, and a flywheel has
to keep it going the rest of the time. It is just like
propelling a bicycle with a single pedal and pushing
the pedal every other time it comes out. It can be
done as long as the wheel is moving fast enough to
carry itself along between power strokes. Naturally
a single-cylinder motor cannot be slowed down very
much without stalling, and it will not start of itself
because it needs outside help in stoking its furnace
before it acquires the power to do this job alone.</p>

TWO-CYCLE ENGINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is a two-cycle type of motor in which the
burnt gases are removed from the cylinder, not by
the piston, but by the injection of the unburnt fuel
mixture. On the upward or compression stroke the
piston not only compresses the mixture in the cylinder,
but draws in a fresh charge of fuel into the
crank case, and when the piston is driven down by
the combustion of the fuel in the cylinder, the charge
in the crank case is compressed until, near the end
of its stroke, the piston uncovers a port in the cylinder
through which the fuel from the crank case is
forced in. (See Figure 51.) Just before this occurs
the piston uncovers an exhaust port in the opposite
side of the cylinder, and the burnt gases start to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
flow out before the fresh charge of fuel pours into
the cylinder. The incoming gas is directed upward
so as to completely scavenge the cylinder of all
burnt gases.</p>

<p>There are no bothersome poppet valves in this
engine. The piston itself acts as a valve, opening
and closing the inlet and exhaust ports as it slides
by them. Every other stroke of the piston is a
power stroke, so that the engine acts like a one-pedal
bicycle, which receives a push every time the
pedal comes around. Unfortunately, the burnt gases
are never completely scavenged, and the fresh charge
of fuel is always more or less diluted by the product
of combustion remaining from the previous charge.
This represents just so much loss of power, and may
interfere with the ignition of the charge. For this
reason the four-cycle engine is generally considered
more reliable and efficient, and is far more generally
used, particularly on motor vehicles.</p>

<p>To overcome the intermittent character of the
internal combustion engine a number of cylinders
are used, which come into play successively. In the
four-cylinder motor one piston is always on the
power stroke. In recent years the number of cylinders
has progressively increased from four to six,
eight, and twelve cylinders, while in racing power
boats the number of cylinders has gone up as high
as twenty-four.</p>

<h3>COOLING THE CYLINDERS</h3>

<p>The temperature of the combustion in a gasoline
engine may be over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Evidently it would melt the cylinder walls were not
special provisions taken to keep them cool. The
usual method is to surround the cylinders with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
water which absorbs the heat, and then cool the
water by passing it through a radiator. Air driven
by a fan through the radiator carries off the heat.
Of course this represents just so much wasted
energy and lowers the efficiency of the motor, but
it is the most convenient way of getting rid of the
intense heat of combustion. Smaller motors, such
as are used on motorcycles, have their cylinders
cooled by direct action of air on the outer surface
of the cylinder. The heat radiated depends upon
the surface exposed and the velocity of the air current.
The radiating surface of the cylinders is increased
by forming them with external ribs or
flanges, so that the air that flows over them,
while the machine is in motion, carries off enough
heat to keep the temperature of the cylinders
within safe limits. In some systems, particularly
in the case of stationary engines, to insure a good
circulation, the air is positively driven against the
flanges by means of a fan.</p>

<p>There are serious disadvantages in using water
to cool an engine. Besides the bother of keeping
the water system supplied with water there is the
danger of clogging the radiator with lime deposits,
and in extremely cold weather the water is liable
to freeze and burst the water jackets or the radiator;
for this reason, air cooling is recommended
by some for automobile engines. In certain air-cooled
automobile engines the cylinders are air-jacketed;
that is, they are surrounded with casings
through which the air is sucked by a powerful fan
driven by the engine shaft, so that the air is bound
to flow if the engine is turning. The cylinders are
ribbed, so that they present a large radiating surface.</p>

<p>Air-cooled engines have hotter cylinders than
water-cooled engines and hence in cylinders of the
same size less fuel is drawn into the air-cooled cylinder.
But the fuel is used more efficiently because
less of its heat energy is wasted; so that air-cooled
engines show a slight fuel economy over water-cooled
engines. On the other hand, when the air-cooled
engine is overloaded or is run at very high
speeds it is liable to become overheated and may
ignite the incoming charge of gas prematurely.</p>

<h3>THE SELF IGNITING DIESEL ENGINE</h3>

<p>As has already been pointed out, compression of
gas generates heat, and one of the reasons for cooling
the cylinders of an internal combustion engine is
to prevent the gas from exploding prematurely on
the compression stroke of the piston. In the Diesel
engine, instead of avoiding such a critical temperature
it is deliberately sought, because it is the heat
of compression, instead of an electric spark, which
ignites the charge. Pure air is drawn into the cylinder
on the suction stroke. This air is under ordinary
atmospheric pressure when it enters, but on
the return stroke of the piston it is compressed to
about 500 pounds per square inch. This raises the
temperature up to the neighborhood of 1000 degrees
Fahrenheit. Into this highly heated air a
spray of oil is injected by air at still higher pressure
and immediately the oil flashes into flame
and the gases resulting from the combustion drive
the piston down.</p>

<p>This is a very economical type of motor. Any
liquid fuel may be used, from light gasoline to
heavy crude oils, or the oils that remain after the
more volatile fuels have been distilled from them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The heavy oils have more heat value in them than
is to be found in light volatile fuels, such as alcohol,
gasoline, and kerosene, and because the oils do not
throw off any inflammable vapors unless highly
heated, they can be stored more safely. This is
of highest importance on submarines and Diesel
engines are commonly used for propulsion on the
surface or to drive the generators which charge the
storage batteries for submerged travel.</p>

<p>In order to inject the fuel into the cylinder
against the pressure of air therein, a powerful air
pump is required. This does not need to be of very
large capacity, but it must compress the air to from
700 to 1,000 pounds per square inch. It may seem
at first as if the work done by the engine in compressing
the air in the cylinder and in operating
the injector pump represents so much loss, but a
moment’s consideration will show that it is all
recovered. The air in the cylinder acts like a spring,
rebounding when the piston starts down on its
power stroke and adding its energy to that of the
burning gases, while the air from the injector
pump also enters the cylinder and helps to push the
piston down.</p>

<p>Diesel engines are made to operate on the two-cycle
as well as the four-cycle principle.</p>

<p>In one type of engine, known as the semi-Diesel,
a lower compression is used in the cylinder. This
is not high enough to ignite the oil that is sprayed
in, and so a hot tube or bulb is employed at the top
of the cylinder against which the fuel jet is directed.
This bulb is heated to a dark cherry red by
means of a torch until the engine has developed
enough heat to keep the bulb at the requisite temperature.</p>

<h3>THE DOUBLE-ACTING JUNKER ENGINE</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-179.jpg" width="400" height="607"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 52.&mdash;THE JUNKER ENGINE IN WHICH TWO PISTONS
RECIPROCATE TOWARD AND AWAY FROM EACH OTHER</p>
</div></div>

<p>An interesting modification of the Diesel engine
is the Junker engine (Figure 52) in which the
cylinder consists of a tube open at each end. In
this there are two pistons which reciprocate toward
and away from each other. Air is compressed between
them as they approach each other and fuel is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
injected into this air, ignites and forces them
apart. Both pistons are connected to the same
crank shaft, one pushing down and the other pulling
up. The pulling piston has a yoke on the end of
the piston rod from which a pair of connecting rods
run down at either side of the cylinder to a pair of
cranks on the crank shaft. Between these cranks
on the opposite side of the shaft is the crank to
which the pushing piston is connected. The advantages
of this arrangement are that the moving
masses are perfectly balanced, the construction of
the cylinder is very simple and especially adapted
to high pressures, and the reaction of the gases, instead
of being directed against a fixed part of the
engine, is directed against a moving piston, thus
reducing the strain on the structure. Of course
the power is not doubled or increased, because each
piston moves only half as far as it would for a
given expansion of gas were it operating in a cylinder
closed by a cylinder head.</p>

<p>The efficiency of Diesel engines, although greater
than that of the gas and gasoline engines, is still
very low. The semi-Diesel will yield about 30 per
cent of the energy in the fuel, the Junker engine
about 34 per cent, and the best Diesel, four-cycle
engine in large units, about 36 per cent. This is a
wonderfully high efficiency compared with that of
a locomotive, and yet it seems pitiably low when we
consider that nearly two-thirds of the energy stored
in the fuel is thrown away.</p>

<h3>SILENCING THE NOISY EXHAUST</h3>

<p>The waste of energy is clearly evident in the exhaust
pipe of an internal combustion engine. The
gases after doing their work on the piston rush out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
with such velocity as to produce a sharp explosive
sound. The noise of the exhaust is highly objectionable
in automobiles and must be overcome, but
instead of utilizing the boisterous energy of the
escaping gases and getting a little more useful work
out of them, means are provided for hushing their
noise. This is done by passing them through a
series of baffles which reduces the pressure of the
gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere.
By letting the gases expand gradually instead
of bursting suddenly into the atmosphere the
noise of the discharge is reduced. However, this
must not be done at the expense of the engine
power. Unless the gases pass quickly through the
muffler they will choke and retard the exhaust and
make the engine do useless work in driving them
through. Even the best of mufflers will use up
nearly 5 per cent of the engine power. The energy
that escapes at the exhaust is not the only loss. All
the heat that radiates from the engine represents
just so much wasted energy. In our water and air-cooled
systems we deliberately abstract heat from
the burning gases and throw it away. If we had
materials that would stand the intense heat of burning
gases and enable us to conserve all the heat developed
in the cylinder we could use our fuels much
more economically.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to utilize the
wasted heat of internal combustion engines, but
they have not met with any considerable degree of
success, with the exception of the invention of William
Joseph Still. This engine, which was the result
of many years of patient work, was first made public
in a paper read before the Royal Society of Arts
in London, May 26, 1919, and when it was shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that the new engine had developed an efficiency of 38
to 41 per cent it was realized that here was a remarkable
advance over any other machine for turning
heat into power.</p>

<h3>COMBINED STEAM AND OIL ENGINE</h3>

<p>The Still engine is a combined steam and gas or
oil engine. The heat that is ordinarily thrown away
in the water jacket and in the exhaust is utilized to
produce steam, and this steam is employed to return
the piston to the top of the cylinder after the gases
generated by the combustion of fuel have driven it
down. While in previous experiments some steam
had been developed from the exhaust gases it had not
been found possible to generate steam in the water
jacket because of the low temperature that had to be
maintained. In the standard internal combustion
engine the cylinder walls are made of cast iron,
thick enough to withstand the heavy pressures to
which they are subjected should the charge be ignited
prematurely. Around them the water circulates
under practically no pressure and so the wall
of the water jacket is made comparatively thin.
Because of the thickness of the cylinder wall the
water has to be maintained at a comparatively low
temperature so as to keep the interior of the cylinder
from growing too hot. In the Still engine the
cylinder wall is from one-third to one-fourth the
thickness of the standard cylinder wall, while the
water-jacket wall is of thick steel. The cylinder
wall is formed with ribs which extend to the water-jacket
wall, so that the latter will take care of any
excessive loads due to premature ignition. Figure 53
shows how the cylinder and jacket of the Still engine
compare with those of the ordinary motor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
thin cylinder wall and the ribs furnish a far better
conduction of heat to the water which circulates between
the ribs. The necessary cooling of the cylinder
can be maintained with water at a much higher
temperature than in the ordinary engine.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 54.&mdash;DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF THE STILL
ENGINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>A diagrammatic representation of a Still engine of
the two-cycle heavy-oil type is shown in Figure 54.
This is shown with an auxiliary boiler heated by
an oil burner. The piston of this engine has a sleeve
which fits into an annular steam cylinder. The
latter is an extension of the combustion cylinder.
Surrounding the steam and combustion cylinders
are the steam and water jackets. The drawing
shows the piston at the end of its downward stroke,
having just been driven down by the gases of combustion.
In this position a scavenging-air port at
the left is uncovered and the burnt gases are swept
out by a blast of air, passing out of the exhaust.
This consists of a bank of tubes or flues which
pass through a water heater. The gases leave the
cylinder with a temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit
and they issue from the exhaust with a final temperature
of only 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Steam now
enters the annular steam cylinder from the steam
jacket, through the port shown at the lower right-hand
side, forcing the piston up and compressing
the charge of air in the cylinder. Then oil is
sprayed in through a nozzle, not shown in the drawing,
and is ignited by the heat of the compressed
air as in a Diesel engine and the piston is driven
down again by the gases of the combustion. The
water surrounding the combustion cylinder comes
from the lower part of the boiler and flows by the
exhaust flues. It is maintained at a temperature of
350 degrees in the water jacket, and here is turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
into steam by the heat of the combustion. Thence
it passes into the steam dome of the boiler. On the
downward stroke of the piston a slide valve, shown
at the lower right-hand side, moves down and connects
the steam port with an exhaust port through
which the steam flows out into a condenser. Water
from the hot well of the condenser enters the system
at the combustion exhaust. The arrows show the
course of the steam and water and the temperature
at various points is given. As may be noted there
are two systems of steam and water circulation: one
from the bottom of the boiler through combustion
exhaust heater to the water jacket and back to the
top of the boiler; and the other from the steam dome
of the boiler to the steam jacket, to the steam cylinder,
to the steam exhaust, to the condenser and
back again from the condenser into the combustion
exhaust heater, whence it enters the boiler by way
of the water jacket.</p>

<h3>LATENT HEAT</h3>

<p>When water turns into steam a certain amount
of heat is absorbed, which does not show in the thermometer.
This is known as latent heat. If cold
water is placed in a kettle and is then heated the
thermometer will gradually rise until the water
reaches the boiling point. Then there will be no
further rise of temperature, although heat is still
applied to the kettle, until all the water is turned
into steam, after which the thermometer will begin
to show a rise of temperature, showing that the
steam is beginning to grow sensibly hotter. In the
engine, shown in Figure 54, a boiler pressure of 120
pounds gauge pressure is maintained, and therefore
water will not boil until it reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
The water in the water jacket registers 350
degrees and is therefore far hotter than it could possibly
be in the open atmosphere. However, the heat
from the combustion does not raise the temperature
of the water, but expends its energy in converting the
water into steam. The cylinder wall is kept at a temperature
of at least 350 degrees all the time, so that
the air that enters the cylinder gathers heat from
the cylinder as well as from its own compression,
and its temperature at the end of the compression
stroke is higher than it would be in a cold cylinder,
thereby insuring the ignition of the fuel when
it is sprayed in.</p>

<p>The Still engine can also be used as a common
gasoline or gas engine of either two or four cycle
and the efficiency in such types is from 31 to 33 per
cent. This is much better than the best airplane
engines, which show an efficiency under 27 per cent.
Although 41 per cent for the best Still heavy-oil engine
is a remarkable accomplishment, yet it does
not begin to compare with the efficiency of the best
water turbines and Pelton wheels, which turn into
useful power from 75 to 87 per cent of the kinetic
energy in the water that drives them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">WHEN COAL AND OIL ARE EXHAUSTED</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN PREVIOUS chapters we have indulged in a great
deal of historic retrospect. It may be well at
this point, while we are dealing with the subject
of power, to look into the future and the prospects
that it holds out to us.</p>

<p>It was about fifty thousand years ago, according
to conservative estimates, that primitive man first
began to use tools, and he managed to exist and
thrive and develop to a very high degree of civilization
during practically the whole of that period
without touching the stores of energy that lay beneath
his feet. It was only yesterday that the
steam engine was invented, and when it was discovered
how to turn heat into work and what a
wealth of power was stored up in the deposits of
coal there started a lavish and profligate squandering
of the precious heritage of the Carboniferous
era. The fossilized vegetation of by-gone ages
is now employed to drive our locomotives and steamships,
to turn our factory wheels, to extract metals
from the ore and help us shape them according
to our needs and desires, to convert iron into steel
and to heat and light our houses. We all know that
there is a limited supply of coal in the world
and that some day the stores will be exhausted,
yet we go on using larger quantities of the fuel
each year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>For the last century our demands for coal have
been doubling every ten years, until to-day the
world is using about 1,200 million long tons per
year. It is conservatively estimated that if our
demands for coal do not increase there is enough
left in the whole world within a mile of the surface
to last 1,500 years. Fortunately this country is
better supplied than many others, and it is probable
that we can get along on our present rations for
2,000 years. England, however, faces exhaustion
of her coal supplies within two hundred years.</p>

<p>After living fifty millenniums on earth as a being
clearly superior to other animals, man comes into
an inheritance which he squanders in one or at
most two millenniums. It is not creditable to our
civilization that we have taken no precautions to
ration out this precious store of fuel.</p>

<h3>OUR WASTE OF FUEL</h3>

<p>As was shown in a previous chapter, we utilize
very little of the energy in coal. Our steam railroads
squander from 94 to 96 per cent of the coal
they burn and our best turbine power plants throw
away about 80 per cent. The coal we burn in domestic
furnaces is most wastefully squandered.
Maybe we shall learn how to use the energy in
coal more efficiently and make it last longer, but
eventually it will all be gone and then what are we
going to do?</p>

<p>Of the other fuels available, petroleum takes the
leading place, but we are hardly more economical
in our use of this fuel and our oil supplies are
diminishing much more rapidly than the stores of
coal. In 1919 the United States produced 376,000,000
barrels of oil and consumed 418,000,000 barrels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
having had to draw on Mexico for 42,000,000
barrels. Natural gas cannot last much longer and
peat bogs are estimated at about half of one per
cent of the coal supplies. Where shall we turn for
heat and power when all these stores of energy
are gone?</p>

<p>It has been estimated that the water powers of
the earth, if fully developed, would probably supply
about half of the energy that we now get out of
coal. This is a never-failing supply of energy, and
no doubt before we have begun to scrape the bottom
of our coal magazines every river on earth that is
capable of turning a wheel will be doing so to the
limit of its capacity. Then there will be a readjustment
of the manufacturing centers of the earth
and remote regions such as Iceland, for instance,
which has more available water power than
Switzerland, will hum with machinery, while
such countries as Great Britain, which is relatively
poor in water powers, will have to give up manufacture
and revert to agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>But are there not other powers that can be used?
If we could capture all the energy of the winds we
should have ample power to do all the work that
is now done on earth with a large margin to
spare. It has been estimated that the winds contain
5,000 times as much energy as is obtained
from coal, but how may we capture so fickle a
power as the wind. It is so variable, sometimes exerting
enough power to lift houses from their foundations
and uproot giant trees, and again sinking
to an absolute calm. In some places wind power
is turned into electricity and then stored up in
batteries; but the cost of doing this is high and
at present uneconomical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h3>“BLUE COAL”</h3>

<p>The ocean Is a vast storehouse of energy. The
quiet but powerful rise and fall of ocean tides,
and the tremendous energy of ocean waves, have
been looked upon with envy by engineers. All sorts
of schemes have been devised for capturing a part
of this energy and putting it into the service of
man. Water power has been aptly called “white
coal” and ocean power “blue coal.” Wave energy
is but another form of wind energy and hence just
as fickle. There is plenty of power to be had, but
it is a costly matter to build a power plant on the
shores of the ocean and any day a storm may arise
which will dash the machinery to pieces and sweep
away the whole plant or convert it into a pile of
wreckage. In a few places, however, Nature has
provided a plant which the ocean has been unable
to destroy and man has adopted the plant to
furnish him with power. There is a rocky cave
on the California coast which is exposed to the
ocean swells. As the swells sweep into the cave
they compress the air therein and this compressed
air is trapped in a reservoir. Then the air that has
been pumped by the ocean is put to useful work.
There are similar caves on other rocky coasts
which could be made to deliver power when coal
becomes scarce and it becomes commercially practicable
to exploit them, but the amount of power they
would furnish would be a mere drop in the bucket.</p>

<h3>SETTING TIDES TO WORK</h3>

<p>The ocean tides are also immensely powerful,
but the rise and fall of the water is so slight and
so gradual in most places that an enormous plant is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
required to obtain any appreciable amount of
power. In certain regions, however, tidal power is
actually in use to-day. At high tide water flows into
a large basin and at the ebb of the tide the outflow of
the basin operates a water wheel or turbine. Power
can be obtained while the basin is filling as well
as while it is emptying. One serious objection to
this plan is that the turbine operates intermittently
and at irregular intervals, sometimes by day and
sometimes by night, depending upon the tide. However,
tide mills need not be exposed to the fury of
ocean storms as are plants that seek to employ the
power of ocean waves. In certain localities the conformation
of the coast is such as to accumulate
the tidal flow and produce enormous differences of
level between ebb and flood tide. In the Bay of
Fundy, for instance, the tide rises seventy feet and
an appreciable amount of power could be obtained
from the flow of water into and out of the bay.
If a sea-level canal were dug across the Isthmus of
Panama there would be a flow of water back and
forth through it because the tides at the Pacific
side have a rise and fall of only two feet while
on the Atlantic side the tide rises twenty-two
feet. Some power might be obtained from the
tidal flow through this canal, but a fall of twenty
feet in fifty miles would not produce a very swift
current.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 55.&mdash;THE ESNAULT PELTERIE PLAN OF UTILIZING TIDAL
POWER IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL</p>
</div></div>

<p>If tidal power is to be utilized at all it must
be done on a grand scale. A French engineer, R.
Esnault Pelterie, has proposed a vast tidal power
system in the English channel where the tide rises
high. (See map Fig. 55.) The plan is a most ambitious
one, but the power that could be obtained is
enormous. He proposes to build concrete dikes
across the channel at the Straits of Calais inclosing a
large basin about twenty miles wide and turbines
would be operated by the flow of water into and
out of this basin. Of course locks would have to be
provided to permit the passage of ships through the
basin. Other and larger basins could be formed by
walling off the estuary of the Thames and the bay
of the Seine on the French coast. The Gulf of St.
Malo could be inclosed by running a dike from
Cape La Hague to the island of Guernsey and thence
to the mouth of the Trieux. These basins would
furnish a minimum of 800 horsepower for each
square mile, hence the basin across the Straits of
Calais alone would furnish nearly half a million
horsepower while the Gulf of St. Malo would furnish
about a quarter of the power that France now
uses in her industries. The first cost of the installation
would be heavy, but there would be no expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for fuel and the supply of power would be
endless. It has been proposed to dam the estuary
of the Severn (England) where the spring tides rise
thirty feet, and it has been estimated that half a
million horsepower would be developed. Part of the
power would be used to pump water into an elevated
reservoir which would serve as a storage battery,
so that when the tidal plant was idle because of the
turn of the tide, water flowing out of the reservoir
would operate an auxiliary plant, thereby furnishing
a continuous supply of power.</p>

<h3>POWER FROM SUNSHINE</h3>

<p>With the exception of the tides all the energy
we use on earth comes from the sun. It is the sun’s
energy that is stored in coal beds and oil fields; it
is the sun’s energy that raises water from the
ocean to the tops of our mountains; it is the sun’s
energy that makes the winds blow, and through
them disturbs the surface of the ocean, and even the
tides owe a part of their energy to the attraction of
the sun. Why can we not utilize the energy of the
sun directly, instead of at second hand? In the sunshine
that beats upon the earth there is seventy-thousand
times as much energy as we now obtain
from coal. Unfortunately the energy of the sun is
so widely dispersed that it cannot be used economically
except in a very few places where clouds
do not often interrupt the direct passage of the
rays to the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>Near Cairo, Egypt, there is a plant erected by
an American inventor, Mr. Frank Shuman, which
develops about fifty horsepower. This consists of
a series of five huge trough-shaped mirrors that
focus the sun’s rays upon boilers and thus generate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
low pressure steam. The mirrors measure 13 feet
in width and 304 feet in length and these are
mounted on a light steel framework with their axes
running north and south so that they may be
turned from east to west to follow the course of the
sun across the sky. In order to prevent the mirrors
from shading each other in the early morning and
late afternoon they are set twenty-five feet apart.
Mirrors are made of thin sheets of window glass,
silvered at the back. The troughs are parabolic in
cross section and at the focus of each is hung a
tubular boiler painted black to absorb the heat
rays. The five boilers feed a common steam reservoir
from which steam is fed to a pump. This
pump raises about 6,000 gallons of water per
minute, which is used for irrigating purposes. Of
course at night the supply of energy is cut off and
on cloudy or rainy days no steam is generated, but
such days are few in the region of Cairo, and continuous
operation is not essential to the operation
of irrigating systems.</p>

<p>There are localities in Africa, Asia Minor, and
even in the United States where the lack of water
and the pitiless rays of the sun have turned vast
regions into deserts. Here the very rays which have
parched vegetation may be utilized to pump water
over the thirsty lands and convert them into rich
agricultural regions.</p>

<p>There is another mighty source of power in the
internal heat of the earth. Here and there all over
the earth are vent holes through which the pent-up
energy makes its escape in the form of steam, gases,
or molten lava. There is no question as to the
enormous stores of energy in active volcanoes, and
as we appreciate the value of heat energy our eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
turn covetously to these great chimneys of the subterranean
furnaces.</p>

<h3>HARNESSING VOLCANOES</h3>

<p>It seems like the height of daring to attempt to
harness the volcanoes, and yet there is a plant in
Italy which utilizes volcanic energy and develops useful
power from it. At Volterra, in the province of
Tuscany, there is a volcanic region where jets of
very hot steam issue from cracks in the ground.
These steam jets, known as <i>soffioni</i>, are laden with
gases and mineral matter. For many years the boric
acid that they contain was abstracted from them,
but the steam was allowed to escape. In some few
instances it was piped into houses and used for domestic
heating. In 1908 an attempt was made to
convert the energy of the steam into useful power.
Holes were bored into the earth and steam of a
temperature of 302 degrees Fahrenheit came up the
pipes. This steam was applied directly to a forty
horsepower steam engine, and for the first time
volcanic heat was set to work. The steam, however,
contained so many impurities that it was impracticable
to use it directly in the engine. The
valves and cylinders were soon clogged with deposits
of boric acid. Then instead of trying to
obtain power directly from the steam, the latter
was used to heat a boiler in which pure steam was
generated. This plan proved perfectly practical and
a 300 horsepower condensing steam turbine was
driven by the energy thus obtained indirectly from
volcanic heat. This power was converted into electricity
and the power was transmitted to the surrounding
villages. After the World War broke out
and Italy began to feel the shortage of fuel, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
price of coal having risen to $50 per ton, the use
of volcanic power was extended. A 3,000 kilowatt
plant was installed and electric current was transmitted
to Florence, Leghorn, Volterra, and other
towns of Tuscany. The exhaust steam from the
boilers was utilized in the boric acid industries.</p>

<p>Other projects for utilizing the internal heat of
the earth have been given serious consideration in
Italy. Near Naples there is the dormant volcano,
Solfatara, the crater of which is filled with a sea
of very hot mud underlying a cool thin crust of
earth. Holes bored into this mud to a depth of a
few feet send forth steam hot enough to do useful
work and a plan to utilize this store of energy is
under way.</p>

<h3>POWER FROM THE CORE OF THE EARTH</h3>

<p>There are regions where the ground is red-hot at
a depth of a hundred feet. While there is no
water present to furnish steam, it is a simple
matter to sink a water pipe down to the heated
earth and then, around this pipe, to drive a ring
of smaller pipes through which steam may find its
way up to the top and be fed either into water
heaters or directly into steam engines. In fact it
has been suggested that such a scheme might be
used almost anywhere. If we bore into the earth,
we find that the temperature grows higher the
deeper we go. The rate of increase of temperature
varies with different localities, but it is very evident
that anywhere on earth temperatures that will
give a steam pressure of ten or more pounds per
square inch can be obtained if we dig down far
enough, and when we find it worth while to do so we
shall probably riddle the earth’s crust with perforations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
through which water will be sent down to the
subterranean furnaces and it will return to us laden
with heat energy.</p>

<p>After all, we shall not be plunged into dire want
when our stores of coal are exhausted. There will
be other sources of power to draw upon, most of
which will be inexhaustible. Furthermore, we have
recently discovered in atoms of matter stores of
energy incomparably greater than any that have
heretofore been used to work the will of man. How
to utilize this energy we have not yet learned, but
the energy is there, and no doubt, some day, probably
long before coal takes its place in museum
collections, we shall be possessed of a new slave,
far more powerful than that which has served us
so far.</p>

<p class="pch">INVASION OF THE SEA</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE POSSIBILITY that the wind was the first inanimate
power utilized by man, has already been
referred to. There are records of the use of sailing
vessels in Egypt that date as far back as 6,000
years before Christ. Navigators of that early date,
however, could hardly claim to have mastered the
wind. They merely used wind power when the wind
was disposed to help them. If the winds were adverse,
they had no recourse other than to furl their sail,
step the mast and depend upon oars to propel them
to the desired port. It was not until thousands
of years later that primitive mariners learned how
to tack and pursue a zigzag course against the
wind. When this knowledge was acquired we do
not know, but it is certain that the Phœnicians,
who rounded the continent of Africa 1,200 years
before Christ, knew how to make use of the power
of opposing winds. Of course they could not explain
how it was that a breeze could be made to
drive a vessel in a direction across and even opposed
to that in which it was blowing. In order to
understand this apparent paradox ourselves, we
must go back to the very elements of mechanics.</p>

<h3>ELEMENTARY MECHANICS</h3>

<p>The popular conception of force is something
that produces motion, but its true definition is “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
which tends to produce <i>or resist</i> motion.” There
are forces in existence when there is no motion.
When you hold a weight in your hand there is a
force tending to pull the weight to the earth, but
this force is opposed by an equal force exerted by
your muscles in holding up the weight. There is no
motion because the two forces are perfectly balanced.
If they were unbalanced, there would be
motion in the direction of the greater force. If the
pull of the arm is greater than that of gravity, the
weight will be lifted, and if the weight is too heavy
for the arm to support, it will go down despite
muscular efforts to prevent it. In one case the force
of gravity will endeavor to destroy motion by opposing
the lift of the arm, and in the other case the
arm will endeavor to resist motion by opposing the
pull of gravity. A book on a table is motionless
and yet it is acted upon by two forces which are
opposed to each other and hence balanced. The
table furnishes a force which resists and balances
the force exerted by gravity. If the book were
heavy enough, in other words, if the force directed
downward were great enough, the table would be
crushed.</p>

<p>When two forces are in perfect balance they must
be equal and opposite. Unless the directions of the
two forces are exactly opposite, there will be
motion in some new direction. Suppose we use an
apparatus such as shown in Fig. 56 to study the result
of three coacting forces. It consists of a T-shaped
frame with a pulley <i>P</i> at each end of the
cross arm. These pulleys turn very freely on their
axes, so that we need not be concerned with any
appreciable amount of friction. Two fine cords running
over these pulleys are knotted at <i>O</i> to a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
short cord. Each cord is provided with a hook on
which weights may be hung. Now if we put a pound
weight on each cord the two <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> will raise the
weight <i>C</i> until the angles between the cords at <i>O</i>
are all equal. In other words each force of one pound
is balanced by two other forces of one pound each
pulling at an angle of 120 degrees to it and to each
other. If we put a 3-pound weight at <i>A</i>, a 4-pound
weight at <i>B</i> and a 5-pound weight at <i>C</i>, the cords
will come to rest in the position shown in Fig. 57.
The weight <i>B</i> being heavier than weight <i>A</i> will pull
the knot <i>O</i> to the right until the angle between
the cords running to these weights is a right angle.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 56.&mdash;BALANCED FORCES&mdash;EQUAL WEIGHTS</p>
</div></div>

<h3>PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES</h3>

<p>Although a force is something that cannot be
pictured it can be represented graphically by means
of a line, letting the direction of the line represent
the direction of the force and the length of the line
the strength of the force. In Figure 58 we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
measure off 3 inches from <i>O</i> to <i>a</i> to indicate the
3-pound force and 4 inches from <i>O</i> to <i>b</i> to represent
the 4-pound force and 5 inches from <i>O</i> to <i>c</i>
to represent the 5-pound force. Now if from <i>a</i> a
line is drawn parallel to <i>O b</i> and from <i>b</i> a line is
drawn parallel to <i>O a</i> we shall have a parallelogram
<i>a O b d</i>, and if we extend the line <i>O c</i> it will bisect
the parallelogram, running diagonally from <i>O</i> to
<i>d</i>, and this diagonal will be found to measure
exactly 5 inches which represents the 5-pound
force. This is what is known as the <i>parallelogram
of forces</i>. It shows us the resultant of any two
forces that are not directly opposite and it gives us
the direction as well as the strength or magnitude
of this resultant. It is only because we happen to
choose the forces 3, 4 and 5 that the angle at <i>O</i> is
a right angle. In Figure 59, where the forces are all
equal, our parallelogram is lozenge-shaped and the
line <i>O d</i> is just as long as the line <i>O a</i> and <i>O b</i>, showing
that its magnitude is the same as that of the
two forces that balanced it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-201.jpg" width="400" height="357"

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The greater the angle between the two lifting
forces the less weight can they lift. If two men are
carrying a ten-pound satchel, each will be lifting
five pounds, if the pull is directly upward; but this
is a rather inconvenient way of carrying the bag
and usually they pull at a slight angle from the
vertical, and so each must carry more than half
the weight. If they move so far apart that the
angle between them is more than 120 degrees, each
will be carrying more than the full weight of the
bag.</p>

</div></div>

<h3>SAILING AGAINST THE WIND</h3>

<p>Now that we know something about the parallelogram
of forces we may return to the problem
of sailing across and against the wind. In Fig. 60
we are looking down on the deck of a ship and the
wind is represented by the arrow. The dotted line
<i>A B</i> represents the direction in which the boat is
traveling and the line <i>C D</i> represents the plane of
a sail. If the line <i>E F</i> represents the magnitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
direction of the force of the wind at the center of
the sail, then we can tell how much pressure is
being exerted directly against the sail, by drawing
the line <i>g F</i> perpendicular to the sail and completing
the parallelogram by drawing from <i>E</i> a line
parallel to the sail intersecting <i>g F</i> at <i>G</i> and another
line parallel to <i>g F</i> intersecting the plane of the
sail at <i>H</i>. Then the length of the line <i>G F</i> represents
the pressure against the sail. If the line <i>G F</i> is half
as long as the line <i>E F</i>, then only half of the force of
the wind is exerted in the direction <i>G F</i>. In other
words, a wind pressure of one pound per square foot
blowing in the direction of <i>G F</i> will do as much
work as two pounds in the direction <i>E F</i>. The force
of the wind has been broken up into two “components,”
one (<i>G F</i>) at right angles to the sail, and
the other (<i>H F</i>) edgewise to the plane, and of
course the latter has no effect upon the propulsion
of the boat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-203.jpg" width="450" height="313"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 60.&mdash;FORCES THAT MOVE A SAILBOAT</p>
</div></div>

<p>If there were nothing to prevent it, the boat would
sail in the direction <i>G F</i>; but the keel of the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
offers resistance to motion in this direction, and we
must construct another parallelogram around the
force <i>G F</i> to find the magnitude of the force exerted
in the direction <i>A B</i>. The line <i>K F</i> is drawn at right
angles to <i>A B</i>, and then the parallelogram is completed
by drawing a line from <i>G</i> to <i>K</i> parallel to
the line <i>A B</i> and another from <i>G</i> to <i>M</i> parallel to
<i>K F</i>. We have then resolved to force <i>G F</i> into two
components <i>M F</i> and <i>K F</i>. The former tends to
push the boat along its course while the latter tends
to make it drift to leeward. The length of the line
<i>M F</i> is little more than a quarter of the length of the
wind force <i>E F</i> and the leeward acting force <i>K F</i> is
actually considerably greater than the forward
acting force <i>M F</i>. Even with a deep keel there will
be some drift to leeward. This is corrected by
means of the rudder of the ship which is turned to
head the ship further into the wind so that although
the boat does not actually travel in the direction
of its axis it may be made to travel along the
course <i>A B</i>. Of course the boat cannot sail directly
against the wind, but it can accomplish the same
result by tacking alternately to port and starboard
so that eventually it can reach a port that lies in the
direction from which the wind comes.</p>

<h3>THE SPEEDY CLIPPER</h3>

<p>Before the advent of the steamship, sailing vessels
were developed to a high degree of efficiency.
The speedy clippers of 1816 to 1845 used to cross
the Atlantic at an average speed of 6 to 9 miles per
hour and sometimes even better, which compares
favorably with a common steam freighter of to-day.
The largest sailing vessel ever built was the
<i>Thomas W. Lawson</i>, a seven-masted schooner. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was launched in 1902, but foundered in 1907 off the
Scilly Islands. This great ship was a steel vessel
395 feet long, with a displacement of 10,000 tons
and a cargo capacity of 7,500 tons. She had a sail
spread of 40,617 feet.</p>

<h3>FROM OARS TO PROPELLERS</h3>

<p>Although a century has elapsed since the first
steam-driven vessel made its way across the Atlantic
Ocean, sails have been as yet by no means swept
off the face of the sea. Nevertheless, even when sailing
vessels had no competitors they did not furnish
a perfectly satisfactory means of transportation.
The fickleness of wind power was felt in this application
as well as in that of windmills, and inventors
racked their brains for some more certain means of
propelling ships. Naturally, when the steam engine
was a proven success, efforts were made to apply
this newly discovered power to ships. How to make
steam drive a ship was a problem. At first it was
proposed to use a system of oars which would be
moved back and forth in imitation of oarsmen and
John Fitch’s first steamboat in 1786 was driven
by a set of paddles operated in a manner similar
to that of paddling a canoe. It was a very natural
evolution from oars to paddle wheel, which consists
of a series of oars mounted in a wheel so that they
will come into play one after the other. The propeller,
although not invented by Col. John Stevens
(as has been popularly supposed), was first applied
by him to steam navigation when he constructed a
small steamboat on the Hudson River in 1804. But
the simplicity of the paddle wheel and its high
efficiency, particularly in quiet harbors and shallow
inland waters, gave it preference over the propeller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
In rough seas, however, the paddle wheel was far
from ideal. It was too easily broken by heavy
waves and between 1855 and 1865 the propeller displaced
it completely for ocean-going vessels.</p>

<h3>WATER JET PROPULSION</h3>

<p>Another curious form of propulsion, which dates
back to the eighteenth century and is still periodically
revived by inventors, is the water jet. The
idea was to have the engine operate a pump which
would drive a stream of water out of the stern of
the boat and drive the boat by reaction. The British
Government actually built two jet-propelled steamers.
One of them, called the <i>Waterwitch</i>, was a
1,100-ton vessel and the other, the <i>Squirt</i>, was a
small torpedo boat. The latter attained a speed of
but twelve knots while a sister ship of the same
steam power driven by a propeller attained a speed
of seventeen knots. The <i>Waterwitch</i> was even less
efficient. Some years ago experimental water-jet
vessels were built in New York in which a jet
only ⅝ inch in diameter with a pressure of 2,500
pounds per square inch was used, but the experiment
proved a failure. The propelling force of a jet
is the reaction of the stream of water against the
orifice from which it issues. The action is just like
Hero’s reaction steam turbine referred to on page
143. The propulsion would be the same were the
jet discharged in the open air or in a vacuum or
against a solid stone wall.</p>

<h3>WATER AND AIR RESISTANCE</h3>

<p>It takes very little power to move a boat slowly
because the resistance that has to be overcome is
merely the parting of the water at the bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
closing in of the water at the stern and the skin
friction along the sides of the hull. In addition to
this there is a similar resistance offered by the air.
At very low speeds the resistances of the water and
the air are practically negligible. In perfectly quiet
water with no air stirring the pull of a cord will
move a ship weighing hundreds of tons, but the
motion will be very slow indeed. Unfortunately
the speed of a ship does not increase directly in proportion
to the power that drives it. Doubling the
power does not double the speed. If it takes ten
horsepower to drive a vessel at a speed of ten knots
it will take not 2 but 2³ or 8 times as much power to
drive it at a speed of twenty knots. In other words,
the horsepower goes up as the cube of the speed.
This is an average condition for ordinary speeds.
For very high speeds the horsepower may have to
be increased as the 4th and even the 5th power of
the speed. The shape of the bow and the stern is
of utmost importance. The parting and displacement
of the water at the bow and the replacement
at the stern produce waves and the forming of
these waves represents so much wasted energy. The
swell that is kicked up by a steamer is evidence of
power uselessly expended. Much of this loss can
be overcome by careful design of the ship’s lines.
A vessel that kicks up a high bow wave&mdash;one that
sails with a “bone in its teeth”&mdash;may present a very
pleasing spectacle and may seem to be traveling
at high speed, but the best designed vessel&mdash;the one
that slips through the water with no fuss&mdash;is much
more economical of power. It is easy to understand
that the bow must be carefully designed to cut
through the water, but it is not so apparent that
the stern must also be shaped to permit the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to flow in readily and fill in the void behind the ship.
If the stern is not carefully shaped, there will be
a serious drag on the vessel. The skin friction of
the vessel is greatly increased by fouling of the
hull with marine growths. At high speeds the wind
pressure on the superstructure is considerable.
Every spar and line adds its quota. A boat that is
traveling in still air at a speed of twenty-two knots
or twenty-five miles per hour is encountering the
equivalent of a twenty-five mile wind which will
exert a pressure of over three pounds per square foot
of frontage.</p>

<h3>FLYING ON WATER</h3>

<p>Instead of cutting through the water modern
speed boats are designed to ride over it. The boats
have flat bottoms which are arranged as a series
of flat planes known as hydroplanes. These planes
form steps and are set at such an angle as to make
the boat rise up on the water in the same way
that a kite rises in the air. The higher the speed
the higher the boat rises so that at full speed it
skims on the surface. Hence there is comparatively
little power wasted in displacing the water. Some
of these boats are driven by air propellers so that
water resistance to the propeller gear is avoided.
These hydroplanes (they must not be confused
with hydroaeroplanes) almost fly over the water.</p>

<h3>FIRST OCEAN STEAMER</h3>

<p>It was in 1807 that Robert Fulton built the <i>Clermont</i>
and established steam navigation by running
a regular service between New York and Albany,
and it was twelve years later that the Atlantic
Ocean was first crossed by a steam-driven vessel.
It was an American vessel, the <i>Savannah</i>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
made the trip. She was a 380-ton ship equipped
with steam power to help her along when the wind
failed. Seventy-five tons of coal and twenty-five
cords of kindling wood were taken aboard to feed
her furnace. This was thought to be ample for the
voyage, but before the trip was completed the fuel
was all gone. The log of the <i>Savannah</i> bears this
entry the night before sighting the Irish coast: “2
A. M. Calm. No cole to get up steam.” However the
captain did raise steam just before reaching Kinsale,
Ireland, by burning wood. Watchers ashore beholding
the smoke issuing from her stack were convinced
that the vessel was afire and boats were dispatched
to the rescue. The <i>Savannah</i> made the trip
from Savannah to Kinsale in 23 days and was under
steam propulsion for only 80 hours of this time.</p>

<p>Regular trans-Atlantic steam service was not inaugurated
until 1838, but for many decades steamers
were equipped with sails to assist them when
the wind was favorable.</p>

<p>The most notable of early steamships was the
<i>Great Eastern</i>, a combined screw and paddle-wheel
ship, 692 feet long, built in 1858. She held
the record for size until 1899 when the <i>Oceanic</i>, 704
feet long, was put into service. At present the <i>Leviathan</i>,
formerly the <i>Vaterland</i>, holds the record
with a length of 920 feet. It is difficult to judge of
the size of a vessel out on the open water. If the
<i>Leviathan</i> were placed in Broadway, New York, she
would span nearly four blocks. Because of her 100-foot
beam she would be too wide to be wedged in
between the skyscrapers that border lower Broadway.
If she were set up on end she would tower 158
feet above the pinnacle of the Woolworth Building.
Her power plant consists of four turbines which total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
90,000 horsepower and the huge vessel is driven at a
speed of 25.8 knots or nearly thirty miles per hour.</p>

<p>The wonder of these huge floating structures lies
not merely in their gigantic proportions but in
the fact that they are able to weather the terrific
wrenching strains of heavy ocean storms. A skyscraper
is built to withstand only the steady and
direct pull of gravity and the variable thrust of the
wind which, except in western cyclones, seldom
amounts to thirty pounds per square foot. Bridge
building is more difficult because of the leverage of
the parts overhanging the foundations. Wind pressures
must be calculated and also the live load of
objects moving over the structure. In naval architecture
enter the problems of building construction
combined with those of bridge building, complicated
by the fact that there is no fixed foundation for the
structure to rest upon. At one moment a ship may
be spanning a trough in the seas and at the next
it may be seesawing over the crest of the wave.
Of course the bottom of the boat is seldom if ever
out of the water and a certain amount of support
is provided throughout the length of the vessel, but
the ship is subjected to the strains of a cantilever
bridge when she is passing over a wave, and to the
strains of a truss bridge when spanning a wave
trough. These strains are increased by the fact
that the structure is in constant motion. A certain
degree of flexibility is demanded of the materials
which go into the structure and of the joints between
the frame members.</p>

<h3>BOATS OF ARTIFICIAL STONE</h3>

<p>Originally wood was used for the hulls of ships;
then between 1845 and 1855 iron supplanted wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Between 1875 and 1885 steel supplanted iron and
to-day efforts are being made to supplant steel with
concrete. The advantages offered by concrete are
cheapness and speed of construction. The first large
vessel built of this material was the <i>Faith</i>, an 8,000-ton
ship. This boat stood up very well in heavy
weather despite the rigidity of her structure. It is
doubtful, however, that a large boat comparable
in size to the <i>Leviathan</i> could weather a severe
ocean storm.</p>

<p>The proposal to build ships of cement created almost
as much of a popular sensation as did the first
iron boat. Although the public had accepted iron
and then steel as a perfectly proper material for
shipbuilding, concrete seemed too much like stone
and it did not seem possible that artificial stone
could be made to float. They did not realize that a
cubic foot of steel weighs four times as much as
the same volume of concrete. Of course concrete
does not begin to have the tensile strength of steel
and consequently the walls of a concrete ship must
be made relatively thick. For this reason a concrete
vessel is heavier than a steel vessel. She draws
more water and requires a larger power plant, and
because of her greater mass she is not so readily
maneuvered.</p>

<h3>SUBMARINE NAVIGATION</h3>

<p>As was explained in Chapter VI, a body will float
only so long as it is lighter than the volume of
water it displaces. It is almost impossible to keep
a body suspended in water unless some portion of
it is exposed above the surface. If it starts sinking
it will keep on going down until it reaches the bottom
of the sea. There is a popular notion that at
great depths water becomes dense enough to float<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
solid iron, but water is practically incompressible
and its density at a depth of five miles is only
slightly greater than that at the surface. An object
must therefore either float on the surface or sink
to the bottom, unless its weight is exactly equal to
the difference between the upward pressure of the
water under it and the downward pressure of the
water above it. Such an ideal balance it is practically
impossible to obtain unless the object itself
is compressible.</p>

<p>How then can a submarine navigate under water
without sinking to the bottom?</p>

<h3>A SUBMARINE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>The first solution to this problem dates back to the
seventeenth century. Doctor Cornelius Van Drebel,
a Netherlander, who was a guest at the court of King
James I of England, built three submarines between
1620 and 1624. These were rowboats covered
over with a water-tight deck and propelled by
twelve oarsmen. It is recorded that Van Drebel discovered
a means of holding the boats submerged by
observing some fishermen towing baskets full of
fish up the Thames. The barks to which the baskets
were attached by cables were weighted down by
the load they were towing, but when the cables
slackened the boats rose a little bit. Van Drebel’s
method of applying this principle was evidently to
attach a weight to the boat which trailed along the
bottom. When the oarsmen propelled the boat, she
was pulled down under the surface by the drag,
but when the rowing ceased the boat would float
up to the surface. King James himself is said to
have made a journey of several hours’ duration in
one these boats, which was kept at a depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
twelve to fifteen feet below the surface. Progress
must have been very slow because the range of the
submarine was given as five or six miles.</p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War David Bushnell
built a submarine with which attempts were made
to sink a British frigate lying in the Hudson River.
This submarine was driven by a hand-operated
screw propeller. The boat was provided with water
ballast tanks, and by pressing a valve with one foot
he could let in water enough to submerge the boat
while with the other foot he could operate a pump
to empty the tanks and bring the boat to the surface.
When the boat was ballasted so that she would
barely float, a vertical screw propeller was operated
to raise or lower her as much as desired. A 200-pound
lead weight was attached to a long cable
which passed up through the bottom of the boat,
and by letting out this cable the submarine could
be made to rise instantly in case of an accident.</p>

<h3>FULTON’S HAND-PROPELLED SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>To Robert Fulton, however, belongs the credit of
building the first submarine operating on the principle
that is now universally used. His boat was
also driven by a hand-operated screw propeller and
was furnished with water tanks which could be
filled or pumped out at will, but after the submarine
was weighted until only the conning tower
showed above water, she was submerged or raised
by means of horizontal rudders or hydroplanes
which could be tilted to any angle desired. Of
course these rudders, like any other rudders, would
not operate unless the boat were in motion. Such
is the case with modern submarines. Like bicycles,
they must keep on going or they will fall. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
are heavy, they will fall to the bottom, and if light
they will “fall” to the surface. When in motion
the hydroplanes will either hold them down or lift
them up according to the angle to which these horizontal
rudders are tipped.</p>

<p>Robert Fulton’s <i>Nautilus</i> had a fish-shaped hull
of copper plating on iron ribs and was twenty-one
feet three inches long by six feet five inches at her
greatest diameter. The screw propeller was operated
by two men. When the boat was on the surface
a sail was raised to assist in driving the boat. This
sail could be folded up like a fan when it was desired
to submerge.</p>

<p>Fulton deserves full credit for anticipating so
many of the essential features of the modern submarine,
but of course the <i>Nautilus</i> was a mere
toy compared to the marvelous machines which
swim under the surface of the sea to-day.</p>

<p>The German U-boats at the outbreak of the war
were 150 feet long and could make only nine knots
submerged and twelve knots on the surface, but later
they grew to a length of 300 feet with a submerged
speed of twelve knots and a surface speed of
eighteen knots. The British in the meantime developed
a submarine that was 340 feet long and had
a displacement submerged of 2,700 tons as against
800 for the largest German U-boats. The speed of
this big British boat is twenty-four knots on the
surface and ten knots submerged.</p>

<h3>SUBMARINES AS SURFACE BOATS</h3>

<p>Despite their name, submarines are really surface
boats. Only when necessity demands are they
submerged. During the war even the U-boats did
90 per cent of their sailing on the surface. Origially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
submarines were built primarily for submerged
travel and consequently they were given the form
of a fish or of a fat cigar, but such a shape was not
adapted for surface sailing. Water piled up on the
nose of the boat and tended to bear her down. To
overcome this, submarines are now shaped more
like a boat with a bow high enough to part the
waves without burrowing into them.</p>

<h3>POWER PLANT OF A SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>The gasoline engines that were formerly used for
propelling the boats have now given way to heavy
oil or Diesel engines, because of the greater
efficiency of these engines and the greater safety of
handling heavy oil. Some submarines have been
equipped with steam power plants. Such is the
power used on the big British submarines above referred
to. Of course any power that involves the
burning of fuel can only be used on the surface. As
has already been explained, an internal combustion
engine burns seven to nine times as much air as oil
and it would be impossible to store enough air on
board to keep the engines going very long; hence
they can be operated only while the hatches are
open to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Coupled to the shafts of the engines are dynamos
which generate electricity and feed it to storage
batteries. A dynamo will serve as a generator when
turned by some mechanical power and on the
other hand when current is fed into it, it serves
as a motor, so that when traveling submerged and
fuel can no longer be used, the generators are disconnected
from the engines but remain connected to
the propeller shafts and driven by the very current
they previously stored in the batteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE COLLAPSIBLE “EYE” OF THE SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>Amidships there is a bridge from which the vessel
can be navigated when on the surface and a conning
tower from which she can be navigated when
running awash. Most of the submerged travel is
maintained at a comparatively shallow depth so
that the submarine can keep an “eye” on the surface.
The eye is the periscope of which there are two so
that in case of damage to one the other may be used.
Periscopes date back to the “Fifties” when they
were used on some experimental European submarines.
In the Civil War, when the river monitor
<i>Osage</i> ran aground in the Red River, her captain,
now Rear-Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge, rigged up
a periscope with which he could look over the high
banks of the river and direct the fire of his guns
upon a Confederate force that was attacking him.
This periscope consisted merely of a three-inch pipe
with a hole at each end cut in opposite sides of the
pipe. Small mirrors were set in the pipe so that
the light coming in through the upper hole was reflected
down through the pipe and out of the lower
hole. This crude periscope is the same in principle
as the modern submarine periscopes except that the
latter are provided with lenses to gather and focus
all the light possible on the eyepiece so that the
operator will have a perfectly clear view. Periscopes
extend fifteen to twenty feet above the roof of
the conning tower. While periscopes are insignificant
objects on the broad seas when a submarine
is moving very slowly, they are made conspicuous
by the wake of foam that follows them when the
boat is traveling even at a moderate speed. For
this reason during the war the Germans developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a telescoping periscope which could be shot up to
the surface whenever desired in order to give the
commander a glimpse of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The submarine is submerged by letting water into
the ballast tanks and then turning the hydroplanes
to a diving angle. There is an after as well as a
forward pair of diving rudders.</p>

<p>When running completely submerged the submarine
is blind and solely dependent upon the chart
and compass. It is impossible to see far under
water. Searchlights are of no value at all. They
will not make visible an object a hundred feet away.
The submarine commander cannot see even the bow
of the boat he is piloting. The ordinary magnetic
compass will not operate when entirely incased in
steel as it is in the hull of the submarine and so a
gyroscope compass has to be used instead.</p>

<p>While the compass serves as a guide for travel
in the horizontal plane the depth gauge must be
watched to see that the boat does not dive too deeply.
The pressure of the sea increases at the rate of 64
pounds per foot of depth. Two hundred feet below
the surface the pressure amounts to about six tons
on every square foot of the surface of the submarine.
Few submarines can stand a greater pressure than
that without being crushed or at least springing
serious leaks. When coming to the surface the
hydroplanes are used and if the boat is to remain
on the surface water is blown out of the ballast
tanks.</p>

<h3>THE “EARS” OF A SUBMARINE</h3>

<p>Although submarines may be blind under water
they are not deaf. Sound detectors are used which
enable them to locate other vessels by the throbbing
of their engines or the beat of their propellers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
so they can avoid collisions when coming up to the
surface.</p>

<p>Despite the perfection of the submarine the sea is
still a great mystery to us. We know only its surface
and its shallows. We have sounded a few
deep holes and brought up samples of deep-sea life,
but we have not been able to penetrate in person
its profound depths and explore with our eyes and
hands the world that is buried beneath its waves.
Three quarters of the globe is covered by water and
if we are to claim complete mastery of the earth we
must find some way of descending into the heart of
the ocean and exploring its deepest valleys.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pch">SLIDING, ROLLING, WALKING, AND CREEPING</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN ALL forms of transportation friction plays a
most important part. If there were no such
thing as friction, it would be impossible for us to
set an object in motion by the means that are now
commonly in use, and once the object were moving
it would be impossible to stop it except by bringing
it up against a wall set squarely across its path.</p>

<p>In transportation on land friction is a much more
serious bar to motion than it is in marine or aerial
transportation. There are two kinds of friction
that we have to contend with; sliding friction when
two contacting surfaces are dragged by each other;
and rolling friction when one surface rolls upon
another. It is impossible to obtain two surfaces
that are absolutely smooth; there are minute elevations
in each that sink into minute depressions of
the other like intermeshing teeth and a grinding
action takes place as these microscopic inequalities
are broken away. Oil reduces the friction by filling
up these inequalities, but the oil itself offers a certain
amount of friction just as water does along the
sides of a moving ship.</p>

<h3>ROLLING FRICTION</h3>

<p>Rolling friction is of a different kind. The intermeshing
inequalities or microscopic teeth are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
lifted out of contact with, one another just as the
teeth of gear wheels are carried out of mesh. But
there is another cause of friction due to the fact
that no objects are so microscopic that they do not
sink into each other to some extent. A wheel is
always rolling out the surface it is turning on just
as a rolling pin rolls out dough. If the surface is of
elastic material such as a steel rail, it springs back
into place immediately after the passage of the
wheel, but the wheel must constantly travel in the
trough of a wave which accompanies it along the
rail. There is a similar wave in the wheel itself
and this ironing-out action produces heat in the
wheel and the rail. It is particularly noticeable in
the flexible tires of automobiles which, after a run
on even a smooth road, become too hot to be grasped
with the bare hand merely because of the waves of
compression and decompression to which they are
subjected.</p>

<p>Both rolling and sliding friction are increased by
pressure because the depression is greater and because
inequalities are brought into more intimate
engagement with one another. The degree of
friction also depends upon the nature of the substances
in contact, but theoretically the area of contact
does not make any difference. It is just as hard
to push a block along a smooth surface on its edge
as on its side.</p>

<h3>PUTTING ROLLERS BETWEEN LOAD AND ROAD</h3>

<p>As intimated in Chapter I the forerunner of the
wheel was probably the roller. It was much easier
to move a heavy object on rollers because rolling
friction was substituted for sliding friction, but the
rollers would not stay under the object; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
traveled only half as fast as the load they carried.
To make them keep up with the load they had to be
mounted on axles which were fastened either
directly to the load or to a cart body on which the
load was supported. Thus the wheel came to be invented,
but except for the fact that it stays by its
load and does not roll out from under it a common
wheel is not to be compared with a roller for
efficiency. To be sure, it substitutes rolling friction
for sliding friction where it contacts with the road,
but the friction at the axle is sliding rather than
rolling. However, drawing an object on wheels is a
decided improvement over sliding it along the road,
for two reasons: the sliding friction at the axle is
reduced to a minimum by choosing materials that
will slide upon each other with comparatively little
resistance, by polishing them smooth and by lubricating
them. But even if these precautions were not
taken there would be a distinct advantage in the
use of wheels because of the relatively shorter travel
at the axle than at the rim of the wheel. If a wheel
is thirty inches in diameter and turns on an axle
one inch in diameter, it will travel thirty times as
far at the rim as it does at the axle; hence the sliding
friction at the axle is far less than it would be at
the point of contact with the ground, were the
wheel locked so that it could not turn. But it is
not necessary to have any sliding friction at the
axle if we revert to the old roller system that prevailed
before the day of the wheel. The axle may
be considered the load and the axle bearing the road.
We can then put rollers between load and road. Because
the road is a circular one that travels with the
load we can line it with rollers throughout its
length, and the load will never lack for rollers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
roll upon. Thus we have the roller bearing which is
so widely used in modern vehicles. Ball bearings
operate on the same principle except that the balls
furnish less contacting surface and are not so suitable
for supporting heavy loads, as are rollers.
Sliding friction is almost completely eliminated and
unless heavily loaded a wheel on ball bearings will
not heat even when the bearings are not lubricated.</p>

<h3>REDUCING ROAD FRICTION</h3>

<p>While there is little friction between a wheel and
the roadway upon which it travels, the roughness of
the road is a very important factor. Every time a
wheel goes over a stone the entire vehicle must be
lifted; this represents so much wasted energy. The
advantage of the pneumatic tire lies in the fact that
it absorbs small inequalities without making it
necessary for the entire vehicle to rise over them.
This means less load lifted and hence less work
done. Large wheels are better than small ones because
they do not sink so deeply into depressions
and because they surmount small obstacles more
readily. On a steel track the size of the wheel does
not make so much difference as it does on a road because
the track surface is smooth and is but little
depressed by the wheel. It has been estimated that
a horse can pull ten times as great a load on rails as
on an ordinary macadamed road. Some years ago
broad steel tracks were laid in some of our city
streets for the use of horse-drawn trucks. They
served very well as far as the vehicles were concerned.
The road friction was reduced considerably,
but the fact was overlooked that the horses
needed a good friction surface under their feet. Two
horses could not pull a truck along the track without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
walking on the track and the smooth steel made
such slippery footing that the tracks had to be torn
out and replaced with common paving.</p>

<h3>INCREASING TRACK FRICTION</h3>

<p>The difference between sliding and rolling friction
is well illustrated in a locomotive. The driving
wheels are turned around by steam power. They
must either roll or slide on the track and the load
they will pull without slipping is a measure of the
excess of sliding friction over rolling friction. To
increase the traction or the adhesion of the locomotive
to the track it is provided with a number of
driving wheels. In some of our largest locomotives
driving wheels are placed under the tender so as
to obtain a maximum of traction.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT LINEAGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE</h3>

<p>When it was first proposed to substitute steam
propulsion for the horse it was not realized that a
rail would furnish enough traction to permit of
hauling heavy loads, and some of the early locomotives
that ran on rails were provided with toothed
wheels that engaged in racks alongside the rails. In
fact, the earliest locomotives were not built to run
on rails but on ordinary roads; in other words, they
were automobiles. The motor car can therefore
boast of a more ancient lineage than the railroad
engine. Joseph Cugnot of France is said to have
built a three-wheeled steam carriage in 1769 which
was so top-heavy that it upset when making a sharp
turn at three miles per hour. Several steam carriages
were built in England in the eighteenth century,
but they were not successful. The real father
of steam traction was Richard Trevithic, of Camborne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Cornwall, whose first steam carriage, built in
1801, carried eight passengers. His third machine,
built in 1804, was the first to run on rails. This was
strictly a locomotive intended to haul cars. It
ran with its load at the astonishing speed of five
miles an hour. Trevithic was the first to exhaust
the steam from the cylinders into the smoke-stack
and thereby increase the draft through the
furnace and generated steam at higher pressure.</p>

<p>All the early locomotives used toothed gears to
turn the driving wheels until George Stephenson
introduced connecting rods to drive the driving
wheels direct from the pistons. George Stephenson’s
“Rocket,” built in 1829, won a prize of 500
pounds in a speed contest when it established a
record of 24 1-6 miles per hour. It also established
the doubtful honor of being the first mechanical
speed monster to exact the toll of human life. On
its prize run it ran over a man and killed him.</p>

<h3>STEPHENSON’S LINK MOTION</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-225.jpg" width="450" height="363"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 61.&mdash;STEPHENSON’S LINK MOTION</p>
</div></div>

<p>Stephenson’s son Robert is commonly credited
with the invention of an ingenious link motion, although
the invention is also claimed for W. T. James
of New York. We must pause a moment for a description
of this ingenious link motion, because it
became a standard in locomotive construction that
is still in service. As explained in Chapter IX
steam should be used expansively in order to obtain
a maximum of efficiency. After a certain amount
of steam has been admitted into the cylinder it is
cut off from the boiler and it pushes the piston by its
own expansion. The speed of the locomotive must
be varied by varying the point of cut-off, and the
direction of motion of the locomotive is reversed by
reversing the motion of the valve. In the Stephenson
link motion this is all effected by the operation
of a single lever. Fig. 61 shows the arrangement.
The valve is moved back and forth by the rod <i>A</i>
which is connected to the arm <i>B</i> suspended from the
frame of the locomotive. The drive shaft is shown
at <i>C</i> and it carries two eccentrics projecting on opposite
sides of the shaft which move the rods <i>D</i> and
<i>E</i> back and forth. The outer ends of these rods are
connected to opposite ends of a curved link <i>F</i> and
a pin <i>G</i> on the arm <i>B</i> engages a slot in the link. The
link is held up by a rod <i>H</i>. As the drive shaft rotates
the slotted link is oscillated back and forth on
its own center. When the link is lowered so that
the pin <i>G</i> is at the center of the slot there is no motion
of the valve rod <i>A</i>, but when the pin is at the
top or at the bottom of the slot the valve rod has its
greatest motion. As the top of the link is moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in one direction while the bottom is moving in the
other direction, it will be plain that the action of the
valve when <i>G</i> is at the top of the link will be the reverse
of the action when <i>G</i> is at the bottom. The
link is raised and lowered by means of a lever <i>I</i>
which is connected to one arm of a T-shaped lever <i>J</i>
which on one side of its fulcrum is connected to the
rod <i>H</i> and on the other to the counterweight <i>K</i>.</p>

<p>There are certain defects in the Stephenson link
motion that we cannot discuss here. These became
serious as engines grew larger and more powerful
so that to-day it has been largely superseded by other
valve gears. The most important of these is the
Walschaerts gear, invented by a Belgian engineer.
This gear, unlike Stephenson’s, is conspicuously
placed outside the drivers and is particularly noticeable
because of its peculiar grasshopper motion. The
action of the gear is so complicated that a description
of it would be out of place in this book.</p>

<h3>MODERN LOCOMOTIVES</h3>

<p>We cannot enter minutely into the development
of the locomotive from the crude machine of
Trevithic’s time to monsters of to-day. There has
been a progressive growth of locomotives in power
and in speed. Our biggest freight engines are so
powerful that they cannot be used for pulling alone
because they can pull a greater load than the draw-bars
of the cars can stand. If placed at the head
of a long train they would yank the forward cars
loose from the rest. Hence they are placed at the
rear of the train to act as pushers or in the middle
of the train where half their energy is expended in
pushing the cars ahead of them and the other half
in pulling the rest of the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The most powerful steam locomotive of to-day
(1921) weighs 342 tons and its tender 107 making
a total of 449 tons. Its length is 105 feet and its
boiler 8 feet 7⅛ inches in diameter. Its low pressure
cylinders (4 feet in diameter) are larger than
the locomotive boilers of 50 years ago. Its high pressure
cylinders are 30 inches in diameter and the
stroke is 32 inches. It may be operated either compound
or simple, <i>i. e.</i>, the smaller cylinders may exhaust
into the larger ones or they may take steam
direct from the boiler. The tractive effort compound
is 147,200 pounds and simple 176,600 pounds and the
total horsepower developed is 5,040. Each cylinder
drives five coupled drivers, in other words there are
twenty power-driven wheels with a pair of trailers
and a pair of pilot wheels. Six and a half tons of
coal are consumed per hour.</p>

<p>In the matter of speed a mile per minute has become
common and regular scheduled runs over long
distances at an average well above sixty miles per
hour have been maintained, but the present tendency
is to reduce speed somewhat in favor of safety.</p>

<p>There are two inventions that have made possible
the high speeds of modern railroad travel: the
air brake, which has already been described; and
the block signal system. The latter, of which there
are a number of different types, being electrical, does
not properly belong in this book.</p>

<p>Stoking a large freight engine or a high speed
passenger locomotive is strenuous work. Three
tons of coal per hour is not an uncommon rate of
consumption. The fireman on a fast express train
gets little rest. To relieve him of this exhaustive
work automatic stokers are now being used. These
convey the coal from the tender to the fire box and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
feed the fuel at a uniform rate. In place of solid
fuel, oil is extensively used in regions where it may
readily be obtained. This simplifies the task of firing
the locomotives. There has also been some use
of powdered coal which is blown into the furnace in
much the same way as oil is.</p>

<p>To-day steam locomotives have found a serious
competitor in the electric locomotive, which is
steadily increasing in favor.</p>

<p>Where traffic is heavy, where long tunnels make
the smoke and gases of a steam locomotive dangerous,
where electric power is plentiful, the steam locomotive
must give place to electricity. As the cost of
coal mounts, the electrification of railroads will
spread and it will be only a matter of time before the
electric locomotive, which is far more economical
in its use of power, will completely supplant the
steam locomotive.</p>

<h3>FIRST AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT</h3>

<p>As we have already noted, the automobile antedated
the railway locomotive. It was an accident
that took the primitive steam carriage off the high
roads and put it on rails. In 1802 Richard Trevithic,
while speeding along a road at the frightful
speed of ten miles per hour, lost control of his
machine, ran into a fence and ripped off a number
of palings. That accident spelled the doom of the
early automobile. So dangerous a machine was not
allowed to run at large. Special tolls and restrictions
were placed on power-driven road vehicles.
As late as 1896 when the automobile had become a
practical machine in France and was being rapidly
developed in this country, England still had a law
prohibiting any power-propelled vehicle to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
over the highways at a higher speed than four miles
per hour and required further that the vehicle be
preceded by a man bearing a red flag.</p>

<p>The most important early American road car was
that built by Richard Dudgeon in 1855, which made
a record speed of forty miles per hour. In 1889 Serpollet,
in France, invented the flash boiler and interest
in steam-driven automobiles was revived. In
a flash boiler water is turned into steam as it is used
by injecting small quantities at a time in a red-hot
tube. In the meantime, however, the internal combustion
engine was being developed. Lenoir, in
France, was the first to build a motor car driven by
an internal combustion engine. He obtained a patent
on such a vehicle in 1860. However, the real father
of the modern automobile was Gottlieb Daimler of
Germany, who patented a motor vehicle in 1884
driven by an internal combustion engine. The next
year Karl Benz, another German, built an automobile.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN PIONEERS OF THE MOTOR CAR</h3>

<p>Pioneer work in this country began with Charles
E. Duryea in 1891. Five years later he took one of
his machines to England, where it entered a fifty-two-mile
race between London and Brighton. There
were many entrants from France, Germany, and
other European countries. The American car won
the race by nearly an hour over its nearest competitor.
Commercial building of automobiles began in
America in 1894. However, it was not until the
opening of the twentieth century that America took
hold of the motor car in real earnest. Since then the
rise of the automobile industry has been phenomenal.
American methods of manufacture were applied and
cars were turned out in quantity. In 1916 the annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
production exceeded a million and to-day the
production is about two million passenger cars and
over three hundred thousand trucks. The motor car
industry is largely responsible for the wonderful
progress in American machine tools that has been
made in the past two decades.</p>

<p>On the race track the motor car has established
a record speed of 131 miles per hour, but of greater
utility has been the motor truck which now competes
with railroads in the transportation of freight.
Owing to New York’s inadequate terminal facilities,
it takes less time to haul a load from New York to
Philadelphia by motor truck than to take the same
load from the warehouse, transport it across the
Hudson River, and load it on a freight car. It has
made the country a part of the city. A short run
brings the farmer’s produce to the markets and his
passenger car keeps him in close touch with city life.
The motor tractor has lightened his work on the
farm and has enabled him to conduct farming operations
over vast areas. Animal power is gradually
giving way to mechanical power. This, however, is
a special branch of automotive engineering which
we must look into.</p>

<h3>WHEELS VS. LEGS</h3>

<p>The success of the automobile depends upon the
character of the roads it has to traverse. Wheels provide
the best form of transportation over a smooth,
hard road, but if the road is soft, the wheel will
sink into the surface and will be greatly impeded.
In traveling over mud or sand runners are preferable
to wheels because they have a broader and
longer bearing surface. In the snowy regions of the
north and the sandy regions of Africa and Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Minor, sledges are used in place of wheeled vehicles.
Sliding friction is less than rolling friction under
such conditions. In fact, only where man has constructed
special roads is it possible to use wheeled
locomotion. It is because in nature we must contend
with all sorts of surface conditions, soft and hard
and seldom smooth, that the rolling principle
of locomotion is not to be found in any species of
animal. The legs of an animal are levers, just as a
wheel is a system of levers, but in the former case
the levers can be folded or extended to adapt themselves
to all the unevennesses of the ground. No
animal can begin to run as fast as an automobile
on a good road, but on the other hand we have yet
to build a machine which will run as fast as a horse
on soft and uneven ground.</p>

<h3>WALKING MACHINES</h3>

<p>Farm operations must be conducted on loose and
broken surfaces for which the ordinary wheeled
vehicle is unfitted. In some cases broad wheels are
used to keep them from sinking into the soil and
they are furnished with cleats so as to give them
a good grip on the ground, but long ago it was realized
that if the horse was to be completely displaced
on the farm a more adaptable form of locomotion
than that of wheels must be furnished. Inventors
sought to make machines that would walk. One
interesting machine of this class which met with a
certain degree of success attempted to combine walking
and rolling. Large wheels were used which
were provided with a series of feet or tread plates
connected by knuckle joints to the wheel rims. As
the wheels revolved, these treads came successively
into contact with the ground and the machine actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
walked on its feet. The feet were broad enough
to prevent the machine from sinking into the ground
and they adapted themselves to inequalities in the
surface. Instead of having to roll over a rock that
lay in its path the machine would plant its feet on
the rock and lift itself over.</p>

<p>A very curious machine of the walking type has
been developed for excavating machines that operate
in soft swampy ground. The machine actually walks
over surfaces that a light carriage could not negotiate.
It consists of a large central turntable
flanked on each side by a pair of broad and long tread
plates which serve as feet. When the dredge is to be
moved, it plants the feet on the ground, lifts up the
turntable, moves it forward, and sets it down again;
then the feet are lifted, moved forward, and planted
on the ground again while the turntable is moved
forward again. When it is desired to make a turn
the machine is swiveled around to the desired direction
while sitting on the turntable with its feet
raised clear of the ground. Of course the speed of
such a machine is very low, but transportation is of
secondary consideration. The main purpose of the
machine is to excavate ditches in soft ground and
only occasionally does it have to move its position.
The turntable provides a broad base that distributes
the load over a comparatively large area
which prevents the machine from sinking into the
mud, and if it should sink into a soft spot it lifts
itself out vertically instead of having to roll out.</p>

<h3>“CATERPILLAR” TRACTION</h3>

<p>Long ago it occurred to inventors that a machine
could travel over trackless wastes if they carried
their own tracks with them. The idea dates back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
more than a century, but only in comparatively recent
times has it been developed to a practical stage.
The track-laying mechanism takes different forms,
but in one prominent type it consists of a series
of plates linked together to form a chain or belt
that passes around a series of wheels. As the
machine progresses the plates are successively laid
down in front of the wheels and picked up behind
them. The wheels consist of a large number of
rollers whose axles are spring-supported so that
they are capable of a certain amount of vertical
movement and as the belt they roll upon is made up
of separate plates they can adjust themselves to irregularities
of the ground and creep over an uneven
surface. Its close resemblance to the creeping locomotion
of a caterpillar has led to the adoption of the
trade name “caterpillar” by one of the large tractor
manufacturers. The tractor belt is driven by spur
wheels at each end and the rollers serve merely to
distribute the weight of the machine along the belt.
The traction is exceedingly great because the belt
is broad and long, giving it a large gripping surface.
For the same reason it will not sink into plowed
ground. Because of its flexible tread surface it
will creep over rocks and stumps, waddle down into
a ditch and climb up the opposite bank. So powerful
is it that it will crash through underbrush with
ease and even small trees yield before it. It will run
over soft mud, deep sand, and even snow with equal
facility. The tread belts on either side of the tractor
are separately driven and by making one belt run
faster than the other it is possible to steer the machine.
In fact it can be made to turn around in its
own length by stopping the belt on one side and
driving the belt on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a machine is ideal for plowing and other
are hauled with ease over the soft plowed ground.
For ordinary farming purposes speed is not essential,
but the possibility of rapid travel with tread-belt
traction was demonstrated in the World War
when small “tanks” were built which could run at
the rate of twelve miles per hour.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">INVASION OF THE SKY</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">FROM the day when man began to assert his
superiority over other animals he began to cast
longing eyes at the sky. Fired with ambition and
stirred with a spirit of mastery he chafed at the
bonds that bound him to earth; but the heavens
remained a forbidden kingdom to him. Many a
bold adventurer who dared to emulate the birds
paid the penalty of his temerity with a broken limb
and even with his life. It seemed as if man were
destined forever to grovel on the bed of the atmospheric
ocean with never a chance to rise except in
dreams and fancy.</p>

<p>It was not until near the close of the eighteenth
century that a means of rising off the earth was discovered.
Two brothers, Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier,
of Annonay, France, were sitting before a
fire, watching the smoke curl up the chimney, when
it occurred to one of them that smoke might serve
as a vehicle to carry them up into the air. They
belonged to a prominent paper-manufacturing
family and naturally turned to that material as the
most suitable for trapping and harnessing the
smoke. They began their experiments with a large
bag of thin paper which they filled with smoke and
floated up to the ceiling. The next step was to
fasten a dish filled with burning embers to the bag,
so that the balloon carried its own smoke generator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
The experiment was tried in the open air and the
balloon arose to a great height. Larger bags were
made of linen and paper and on the fifth clay of
June, 1782, a public exhibition was given. A pit
was dug in the ground in which a fire was lighted
and over this was placed a huge balloon which
weighed 300 pounds. Eight men were required to
hold it down while it was filling with heated air
and, when released, it shot up to an elevation of
about 6,000 feet and came to earth about a mile and
a half away.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST HYDROGEN BALLOON</h3>

<p>When the news of this event reached Paris a
professor of physics named Charles suggested that
hydrogen, being much lighter than air, would raise
the balloon without the use of fire. By a popular
subscription funds were raised to defray the expenses
of securing enough iron filings and sulphuric
acid to generate the hydrogen necessary to fill a
balloon of 22,000 cubic-foot capacity. On the 27th
of August, 1783, a flight was attempted. The big
bag arose without mishap and disappeared in the
clouds. Three quarters of an hour later it landed
in a field fifteen miles away much to the astonishment
of the villagers thereabout who gathered
around the strange bobbing monster with mingled
fear and curiosity. One of the number, more daring
than the rest, advanced and shot the balloon,
whereupon the crowd closed in and tore it to pieces
with their pitchforks.</p>

<p>In November of the same year the Montgolfier
brothers built a balloon 48 feet in diameter and 74
feet high, and Jean François Pilatre de Rozier, a
professor of natural history, made several ascents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
with the balloon held captive. Then, in company
with the Marquis d’Arlandes, the balloon was cut
loose and the balloon voyage was undertaken.
Below the car of the balloon was an iron vessel in
which a fire was maintained to furnish the heated
air. The aeronauts each carried a bundle of fuel
to feed the fire and a wet sponge to extinguish
sparks that might ignite the bag. Despite this precaution
a number of holes were burnt in the envelope,
but nevertheless the flight was successful
and the daring voyagers came to earth without
mishap after a short journey.</p>

<p>M. de Rozier’s career as an aeronaut was a short
one. The first man to be carried up in a balloon,
he was also the first balloon victim. He undertook
to combine the Montgolfier and the Charles systems
by building a balloon that employed both the hot
air and the hydrogen principles, but the balloon
took fire and De Rozier with his companion, the
Marquis de Maisonfort, were both killed. Two
months after De Rozier’s first balloon ascension a
flight was made at Lyons in a huge fire balloon
which carried seven passengers. This big bag was
100 feet in diameter and 130 feet high, with a
capacity of 590,000 cubic feet. The invasion of the
air was now well under way, although for a time
it made little real progress. Owing to the danger
of fire, hot air eventually gave way to hydrogen
and later to coal gas, which, although it did not
have half the lifting power of hydrogen, possessed
the advantage of being much cheaper.</p>

<h3>THE WEIGHT OF AIR</h3>

<p>It seems hardly necessary in this day and generation
to explain that a balloon rises because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
is lighter than the air it displaces, but it does seem
astonishing that a balloon weighing several tons
may yet be lighter than an equal volume of air. We
do not ordinarily think of air as having any weight.
We know that the ocean of air bears on the earth
with a pressure of about 14½ pounds per square
inch, or about a ton per square foot at sea level.
This amounts to 28 millions tons per square mile
and, when we multiply this figure by the number
of square miles of surface in the total area of the
earth, we find that the whole ocean of air has a
weight of 5,500,000,000,000,000 tons&mdash;a figure
which is far beyond our conception, but it does impress
us with the fact that air is a ponderable substance.
Of course, the atmosphere that exerts a
pressure of 14½ pounds per square inch is scores
of miles deep, but even a small quantity of air has
appreciable weight. If weighed in a vacuum a
cubic foot of air would tip the scales at 1¼ ounces,
and 100 cubic feet would weigh close to 8 pounds.
The air in an empty room 10 feet square and with
a 10-foot ceiling weighs nearly 80 pounds at a temperature
of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In other words,
if we had a box measuring 10 feet on each side and
weighing less than 80 pounds in a vacuum it would
float in the atmosphere when the thermometer was
down to the freezing point, provided there was no
air in the box to weigh it down.</p>

<p>Vacuum balloons were proposed long before the
time of the Montgolfier, but the problem was to
construct a vessel strong enough to resist the crushing
pressure of the atmosphere. The best bracing
for the walls of the vessel is some gas dense enough
to exert a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere
but whose weight is less than that of the air. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
weight of the vessel must then not exceed the difference
between the weight of the gas and an
equal volume of air. The Montgolfier brothers used
heated air to keep their box or envelope distended.
Air expanded by heat is lighter than cold air.
However, it does not make a very good filler
because 1,000 cubic feet of air heated to 212 degrees
Fahrenheit weighs 59 pounds, leaving only
21 pounds on a freezing cold day for the absolute
weight of our 1,000-cubic-foot box. Coal gas, on
the other hand, weighs about 40 pounds per 1,000
cubic feet at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, while the same
volume of hydrogen weighs only 5½ pounds. If
coal gas were used to brace our box against the
pressure of the air we should have a surplus of
about 40 pounds for the weight of the box, while
hydrogen would allow us 74½ pounds. Of course,
the weight of a volume of gas depends upon its
density. No matter how small a weight of gas we
placed in the box it would fill the box completely,
but when we speak of a 1,000 cubic feet of gas or
hydrogen we mean a volume sufficiently dense to bear
against the container with the same pressure that
the atmosphere presses outside; <i>i. e.</i>, 14½ pounds
per square inch. Temperature also affects the
pressure. In the case of fire balloons the hot air
inside the envelope is less dense and hence lighter
than cool air outside, but the pressure is equal because
the former is expanded by heat. The volume
of gas in a hydrogen or coal-gas balloon varies
greatly with the temperature to which it is subjected.
For instance, if on rising through a cloud or
a blanket of fog, the balloon should encounter the
rays of the sun, the heat would burst open the
envelope were no vent provided. The mouth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the bag is kept open, however, for just such
emergencies so that the surplus gas may escape.
On the other hand, sudden chilling of the gas will
contract it and send it down to earth, or the balloon
might encounter a downward current of air,
when the only salvation of the aeronaut is to throw
out the ballast.</p>

<h3>BALLOON NAVIGATION</h3>

<p>Balloons seem like very helpless craft, and yet
they are capable of skillful navigation at the hands
of an experienced pilot. Although the balloonist
has no means of self-propulsion and must drift with
the winds, he is capable of controlling motion in the
vertical direction and can choose the particular air
currents on which he desires to ride. By throwing
out sand ballast the bag may be made to rise
and by letting out the gas it may be made to descend,
and a pilot who is familiar with prevailing
currents of the atmosphere or able to interpret
meteorological indications, may locate the air
stream that will carry him to his destination. Sand
is the balloonist’s fuel; when that is gone the balloon
may as well come to earth at once. Its course
can no longer be directed and there is nothing to
prevent it from being suddenly dashed to earth
should it run into an “air hole,” which is another
name for a downward air current. When a balloon
comes to earth it is liable to be dragged by the
wind and many accidents from dragging occurred
in the early days of aeronautics until John Wise,
an American, invented the rip panel by which the
envelope may be ripped open by pulling a cord,
thus freeing the gas and permitting the bag to collapse
instantly.</p>

<h3>SEVEN MILES ABOVE THE EARTH</h3>

<p>The greatest altitude ever attained by a balloon
has been claimed for Glaisher and Coxwell, who in
1862 went up to a height of seven miles. Both men
were overcome by the extreme rarity of the atmosphere.
Coxwell, however, although nearly paralyzed
and unable to move his arms, succeeded in seizing
the safety valve rope in his teeth and pulled it before
he lost consciousness. The balloon was then
at an altitude of 29,000 feet and rising at the rate
of 1,000 feet per minute. Thirteen minutes elapsed
before he regained his senses, and then the balloon
was falling at the rate of 2,000 feet per minute.
From the data furnished, it has been estimated that
an altitude of 37,000 feet was reached. While there
has been much dispute as to the authenticity of this
record, the altitude of 35,100 feet established in
1901 by Professor Berson and Dr. Suring in the
German balloon Preussen, probably represents a
higher ascent than that of Glaisher’s balloon.</p>

<p>The new system of aerial transportation proved
very useful in the nineteenth century. During the
siege of Paris, in 1870-1871, sixty-six balloons arose
out of the beleaguered city, and all but seven made
their escape in safety. In our own Civil War captive
balloons were first used to direct the fire of
artillery. It was in one of these balloons that
Friedrich von Zeppelin, who was a German military
attaché with the Union forces, made his first
aerial ascent. He was so impressed with the advantages
of military observation from such a lofty
aerie that he became from that moment an aeronautical
enthusiast, and on his return to Germany
urged upon the military authorities the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the balloon in war. It was then that he
began his aeronautic studies and experiments
which culminated in the construction of the gigantic
ships of the air with which Germany undertook
to carry the terror of war into England.</p>

<h3>KITE BALLOONS</h3>

<p>In the World War captive balloons were extensively
used by both sides, an important development
being the kite balloon. The common
spherical captive balloon is very unsteady except in
perfectly still air. It bobs around and swings and
turns, making an unfavorable base for careful observation.
In heavy winds it is liable to be dashed
to earth by sudden gusts. The kite balloon is held
up not only by its own buoyancy, but also by the
wind in the same way that a kite is supported. The
bag is elongated (sausage-shaped) and is fastened
to the anchor line in such a way that it is tilted
like a kite. To assist in holding it in this position
the balloon is ballasted at the after end and the
ballast, if you please, is air. A big air-filled bag
hangs from the stern of the balloon and serves as a
rudder while two other horizontal bags serve as
stabilizing fins.</p>

<h3>SELF-PROPELLED BALLOONS</h3>

<p>No sooner had the Montgolfier brothers proved
that it was possible to rise off the earth upon a
bubble of hot air, than inventors began to devise
schemes of propelling the bubble and controlling
its course. The first dirigible balloon was built in
1784 and, strangely enough, oars were used to propel
it. The balloon had a fish-shaped body, just
like that of modern airships, and the bag was kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
inflated by means of air as it is to-day. It was
realized even at that early date that the envelope
must retain its shape if it is to plow through the
air with a minimum of friction. As the gas would
gradually leak out of the envelope the bag would
become flabby and present a crumpled bow to the
ocean of the air and, to overcome this, a double
envelope was provided and air was introduced
between the inner and outer skin. Means were
provided for pumping air in as the gas slowly
escaped, thus keeping the envelope fully inflated.
As the air was pumped in sand ballast was thrown
overboard so that the buoyancy of the airship was
not impaired. To-day air is used to keep gas envelopes
inflated, but instead of placing the air in
an outside envelope it is introduced into a small
bag inside called a “ballonet.”</p>

<p>From time to time other means of propulsion
were proposed and tried. In 1852 Henri Giffard,
who is known as the Fulton of aerial navigation,
built and operated a dirigible driven by a steam
engine, which he hung at a considerable distance
below the gas bag, so that the fire box would not
be liable to ignite the highly inflammable gas. A
draft was maintained in the fire box as it is in
a locomotive by letting the steam discharge into
the smoke stack, but in this case the stack was inverted
and the smoke and gases were blown downward
and away from the coal gas with which the
balloon was inflated. The danger of fire and the
difficulty of building a power plant light enough to
be carried aloft and powerful enough to give the
craft any material headway were the chief obstacles
that had to be overcome. At the close of the nineteenth
century, Santos Dumont, a Brazilian inventor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
built a balloon that was driven by a gasoline
engine. Despite the apprehension of other aeronauts
this machine proved an unqualified success.
Two years later, in 1900, Count Zeppelin introduced
the rigid dirigible, which to-day is the standard for
large airships.</p>

<h3>THREE TYPES OF DIRIGIBLES</h3>

<p>There are three types of dirigible airships; the
flexible, the semirigid, and the rigid. In the flexible
type, as we have observed, the envelope must
be kept tightly filled in order to hold its shape when
driven against the air. The car is suspended from
the gas bag. In the semirigid type a rigid frame
or backbone serves as a keel for the gasbag and
helps to prevent it from crumpling up. In the rigid
type a casing incloses the gas or rather bags;
for the gas Is contained in a number of separate
bags fitted into separate compartments. The casing
is composed of a framework of duralumin, which
is an alloy of aluminum, with a percentage of
copper and nickel. It weighs but little more than
aluminum, but is five times as strong. Over the
duralumin framework is stretched a sheathing of
rubberized fabric. Because of the weight of this
casing rigid dirigibles must be made in large size.</p>

<h3>ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN A DIRIGIBLE</h3>

<p>Before the war large Zeppelins were built that
were fitted with luxurious cabins and dining rooms
and made regular scheduled voyages. The big British
dirigibles are of the Zeppelin type. The R-34,
was 672 feet long and 79 feet in diameter. It was
fitted with nineteen gas bags and had a total capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of over two million cubic feet of hydrogen. It was
driven by five engines, each developing from 250 to
275 horsepower, and was capable of making from 50
to 75 miles per hour, depending upon whether or
not the engines were pushed. The big dirigible left
the Royal Naval Air Station, near Edinburgh, on
the 2d of July, 1919, and landed at the Roosevelt
Field near Mineola on the 6th, having made the
trip in four days and two hours. The course covered
about 3,100 sea miles, but the actual air mileage
was about 6,300 miles because head winds were
encountered. In aeronautic voyages it is the distance
through the air that must be reckoned rather
than the distance over the ground or sea. An airship
may be traveling at the rate of 50 miles per
hour through the air, but if there is a wind of 30
miles per hour blowing against the course of the
dirigible, the latter will be making only 20 miles
per hour over the ground, or if the wind is blowing
with the airship it will be making 80 miles per hour
over the ground. Because of the head winds the
transatlantic flight of the R-34 was so much longer
than had been anticipated that its stores of fuel
were almost completely exhausted. And yet, when
the airship started out from Edinburgh, it carried
81 tanks of gasoline, each containing nearly
70 gallons, or a total of 4,900 gallons. This fuel
weighed nearly 16 tons. Almost a ton of oil and
3 tons of water added to the load and the baggage
and crew amounted to 4 tons more. The total
weight carried was over 24 tons and the dirigible
fully loaded weighed altogether about 60 tons. When
the dirigible started out it had to fly low, but as
the fuel was consumed it grew lighter and rose
higher. The surplus hydrogen had to be pumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
into steel tanks where, owing to its compression, it
was heavy and served as ballast which could at
any time be fed back into the gas bags to increase
the buoyancy of the airship. We can no longer think
of air as having no weight when we consider that
all this tonnage was supported by air.</p>

<p>The R-34 was by no means the largest dirigible
built, but we dare not boast of the size of the airships
of to-day when the aeronautics is in its in-fancy,
because our present dirigibles may seem
puny alongside the big aircraft that may be built
to-morrow. The dimensions of the R-34 have been
given because of the historic interest in this first
dirigible to span the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<h3>HEAVIER-THAN-AIR MACHINES</h3>

<p>Marvelous as was the achievement of the Montgolfiers
and wonderful as were the aeronautic
developments that followed the invention of the
balloon, the dominion of the birds was not really
conquered until man had learned how to fly in a
machine heavier than the air. Captive aeroplanes
date back to the remote ages of ancient history.
Kites are really “heavier-than-air machines.” They
maintain themselves in the air because they travel
through the air at a considerable velocity. True, a
kite may be stationary, or practically so with
respect to the ground, but if we detach ourselves
from the ground and view the situation from a
drifting balloon, the earth will appear to be moving
under us and the kite will rush past us as it
is dragged by the earth to which it is tied. The
idea of propelling a kite through the air, not by
tying it to the earth, but by furnishing it with its
own propeller and power plant, was conceived long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
ago, but the problem was to find a power plant light
enough. The honor of being the first man to rise off
the ground in an aeroplane belongs to C. Ader, who
made several short flights between 1890 and 1896
in a machine driven by a twenty-horsepower steam
engine. Our own S. P. Langley did some most
important pioneer work in flying and built a man-lifting,
steam-driven machine in 1903 which would
have flown had it not been for an accident to its
launching gear. In fact, this very model was flown
successfully a number of years later. However, it
was not until the gasoline engine was developed
that the power plant problem was solved. The
internal-combustion motor was made more and
more powerful in proportion to its weight until
now there are several types that weigh less than
two pounds per horsepower.</p>

<p>But the power plant was only one obstacle to be
overcome. The real problem was to learn how to
control the machine after it rose into the air. Otto
Lilienthal attempted to learn how to fly in a motorless
flying machine. He provided himself with
wings and, jumping off a height or running down
a slope, depended upon gravity to furnish him with
the necessary propulsion through the air. Unfortunately
after five years of gliding experiments a
fatal accident terminated his aeronautic research.</p>

<h3>THE WRIGHT BROTHERS</h3>

<p>In this country the Wright brothers, Orville and
Wilbur, took up the work of Lilienthal and they,
too, undertook to learn to fly before they built a
flying machine. In all his years of experiment,
Lilienthal did not have more than five hours of experience
in the air. The Wright brothers determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to spend more time in the air and less in
theoretical speculations at home, so they built a
gliding machine that would sustain a man at a
speed of eighteen miles per hour and picked out a
spot on the Atlantic coast where they were assured
of fairly constant winds of sixteen to twenty-five
miles per hour. At first the machine was used as a
kite and various experiments were made in balancing
it. Then short gliding flights were made from
the tops of the sand dunes. Not until the art of balancing
the glider and controlling it in unsteady air
currents was any attempt made at building a motor-driven
flying machine. It was by these experiments
that the Wright brothers discovered the system of
warping the wings so as to preserve the lateral
balance of the machine. After several seasons of
experimental gliding, and not until they felt that they
had learned how to fly, was a power machine built.
This made its first flight on December 17, 1903.
The first flight lasted only twelve seconds, while the
fourth flight lasted fifty-nine seconds. Many months
were spent in perfecting the machine and in solving
the various problems of flight, and not until September,
1905, did the Wright brothers feel that they had
mastered the art of flying. After that three years
elapsed before the world was actually convinced of
the reality of airplane flight and recognized the
work of the pioneers.</p>

<h3>TRANSATLANTIC AEROPLANE FLIGHTS</h3>

<p>The development of the heavier-than-air machine
is so recent and is still advancing so rapidly that
we dare not give more than a brief outline of its
progress here. The more important advances are
familiar to most of us and a record of achievements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to-day will be hopelessly out of date to-morrow. The
war gave a tremendous impetus to flying. Pilots
were trained by the thousand. Machines grew
in speed up to 150 miles per hour. Huge bombing
machines were built, with a wing spread of over
125 feet, and weighing ten to fifteen tons. These
were capable of carrying a load of four to five tons.
The first flight across the Atlantic was made in June,
1919, by the United States navy flying boat NC-4,
which flew to Newfoundland, then to the Azores,
and from there to Lisbon, Portugal. The trip was
finally completed by a flight to Plymouth, England.</p>

<p>The first nonstop flight was made in the same
month by a Vickers Vimy bomber which, with a
favoring wind of thirty miles per hour, made the
trip in less than eighteen hours at a rate of 120 miles
per hour. To-day all-metal aeroplanes are being
flown successfully. Plans are under way to build
aeroplanes for service at extremely high altitudes,
where greater speeds are possible owing to the
tenuity of the air and the consequent lowering of
head resistance. These machines are to have inclosed
bodies in which air at normal pressure will
be maintained by means of blowers. The blowers
would also furnish the engines with air necessary
for proper combustion of the fuel.</p>

<p>We are not going to give a history of the progress
of aviation since the invention of the Wright
biplane, but instead we shall look briefly and in a
very elementary way into the principles underlying
the flight of heavier-than-air machines.</p>

<h3>WHY A KITE STAYS UP</h3>

<p>What is it that makes a plane or a kite stay in the
air? The answer is inertia. The balloon shows us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
air possesses weight; the aeroplane shows us that air
possesses inertia. This is a natural consequence.
Every body possesses inertia and the heavier the
body the greater its inertia. By inertia we mean resistance
to change of motion or rest. The pressure of
air against the face of a fan is due to its resistance
to a change from state of rest to a state of motion,
while the pressure of wind against a surface represents
the resistance of air in motion to being brought
to a state of rest. The more sudden the change the
higher is the resistance or pressure developed. If
an open newspaper be laid over one half of a ruler,
while the other half extends beyond the edge of the
table, the ruler may be broken by a sharp blow on
the overhanging end, not because the other end
is held down by the weight of the newspaper, but
because the inertia of the air bearing on the broad
area of the paper prevents the ruler under the
paper from rising in response to the sudden blow at
the overhanging end. It is the inertia of the air,
<i>i. e.</i>, its resistance to rapid displacement that keeps
a parachute from falling like a solid shot to earth.</p>

<p>Figure 62 shows how a kite is maintained in the
air. The line <i>AB</i> represents the plane of the kite,
the line <i>CO</i> at right angles to this plane is the
pressure against the center of the kite surface. The
wind pressure <i>DO</i> is resisted by the pull of the
kite string and exerts a lift <i>EO</i>, which resists the
vertical pull of gravity. The sum of the forces
<i>DO</i> and <i>EO</i> must be equal to the force <i>CO</i>. If <i>EO</i>
is greater than the force of gravity the kite will
rise, and if it is less the kite will fall. The magnitude
of the force <i>EO</i> depends upon the velocity of
the wind <i>DO</i> and the angle of the kite <i>AB</i> to the
wind. If the plane of the kite were parallel to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
direction of the wind the angle would be zero and
the lift would also be zero.</p>

<h3>FORCES THAT SUPPORT AN AEROPLANE</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-253.jpg" width="400" height="352"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 62.&mdash;FORCES WHICH HOLD UP A KITE</p>
</div></div>

<p>In an aeroplane conditions are just the same as
in a kite, except that a propeller drives the plane
through the air with a force equal to <i>CO</i>. The
plane is slightly curved, so that air which is deflected
or forced down at the forward edge will
continue to press against the plane all the way to
the rear edge. The shape of the top of the plane is
also important. As the plane is driven through the
air a partial vacuum is formed above the plane, so
that the difference in pressure between the two sides
is increased and there is a greater lifting effect. This
partial vacuum is known as “cavitation.” In the
early days of the aeroplane it was not realized how
important was the effect of cavitation on rapidly
moving objects. Every spar and member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
airplane as it plows through the air builds up a
head resistance in front and is followed by a wake
of rarefied air unless it is given a stream-line construction.
This is illustrated in Figure 63, which
shows at the left a rectangular body traveling
through the air and at the right a stream-lined
body. The flow of the air is indicated by the lines
and it is evident that head resistance and cavitation
are reduced by forming the body with a bulging
bow and tapering stern. To-day all the exposed
parts of aeroplanes are stream-lined as far as possible.
In the early Wright machines wire braces
were extensively used. It was not supposed that a
wire would offer much resistance to the air, but,
upon investigation, it was found that the wire
braces would vibrate laterally and present virtually
a broad surface which materially increased the
head resistance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-254.jpg" width="450" height="130"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 63.&mdash;FLOW OF AIR AROUND A RECTANGULAR BODY
AND A STREAM-LINED BODY</p>
</div></div>

<p>The angle of the plane determines to a large extent
the head resistance of the plane. If the plane
is horizontal the head resistance is at a minimum,
but the lift is also very slight. If the wing planes
were perfectly flat, there would be no lift at all, but
because of the curve of the wings there is a certain
amount of lift when they are horizontal, and even
when they are tipped slightly downward, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the machine is traveling at high speed. The angle
of an aeroplane’s wings is therefore much flatter
than that of a kite.</p>


<h3>MAINTAINING THE EQUILIBRIUM OF AN
AEROPLANE</h3>

<p>In order to maintain itself in equilibrium the
center of gravity must coincide with the center of
pressure, otherwise there will be a turning action
about the center of gravity and the machine will
upset. The location of the center of pressure depends
upon the angle of the plane. The greater the
angle the farther it is from the forward edge of
the plane and the pilot can maintain fore-and-aft
equilibrium by tilting the horizontal planes of his
rudder so as to change the angle of the machine,
and hence of the main or forward planes. Unfortunately
the air is a turbulent ocean filled with
invisible air currents and the aeroplane must be
capable of adjustment to meet the variations of
pressure due to sudden gusts of wind. This is
particularly true of lateral balance. A gust coming
from the side will put a greater pressure on
one side of the aeroplane than on the other. To
meet this the angle of the plane at one side must be
less than that at the other. This was discovered by
the Wright brothers and their method of overcoming
the lateral variations of pressure was the key
to their early success. They warped their wings or
twisted them so that the angle of the wing was
reduced on the side from which the gust came and
was increased on the other, and thus the center of
pressure over the whole wing was kept on the line
of the center of gravity. At the same time there
was a variation in head resistance which had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
corrected by moving the rudder, and the Wright
brothers used a single lever to warp the wings and
at the same time to operate the rudder so as to keep
the aeroplane on its course.</p>

<p>Before the Wright brothers made public their invention
other aeronauts had great difficulty in making
turns. When turning, one side naturally has to
move through the air faster than the other. This
produces an increase of pressure on one side over
the other which may be counterbalanced by warping
the wings. The same effect is produced by the
use of small wing planes, called “ailerons,” at each
side of the main planes. An automatic means of
stabilizing an aeroplane has also been devised, a description
of which will be found in Chapter XXI.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pch">HELPING THE FARMER</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE FIRST efforts at directing the forces of nature
and employing them in the service of man were
made by the farmer. The task of growing food
was quite the most important of primitive occupations,
and although the virgin soil was rich and the
yield abundant there were regions where crops
could not be raised except at the expense of constant
toil. Infrequent rains made it necessary to
carry water by hand from wells and rivers and
pour it over thirsty lands. As the grain fields grew
more extensive, irrigating ditches were used which
saved the toil of carrying the water, although it
still had to be raised by hand. Then machines were
invented by which water could be raised by animal
power and, finally, as we have already seen, automatic
water-lifting machines were constructed by
which the river itself was constrained to lift a part
of itself and pour this part into the irrigation
ditches.</p>

<p>While it is true that the earliest machines were
built to lighten the work of the farmer, the attention
of inventors was soon attracted to other fields
of endeavor and the farmer was left to toil slavishly
from daybreak to sundown with no further mechanical
aid. The tools he used were improved in
form and quality. Oxen were used to draw the
plow. The wooden plow made out of a forked stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
gave way to a bronze plow and, finally, to one of iron.
The curved knife or sickle went through a similar
process of evolution from flint to iron. It was the
only implement used for cutting the standing grain,
and not until comparatively recent times did it give
way to the scythe. Practically all the work of tilling,
seeding, cultivating, harvesting and threshing
was done by hand in practically the same way and
with practically the same tools from the time of the
Pharaohs down to the end of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST HARVESTING MACHINE</h3>

<p>To be sure, there is a record of a harvesting
machine built in Gaul, while that province was
under Roman dominion. Pliny described this
machine in 70 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> It consisted of an ox cart
which was <i>pushed</i> through a field of grain, instead of
being <i>pulled</i> by the ox. This cart carried a rack or
comb which caught the heads of the standing grain,
tearing them off and delivering them into the body
of the cart. Unfortunately this primitive, but useful,
harvester was not extensively employed and in
time it was lost to agriculture. Farmers reverted
to the time-honored method of reaping by hand and
the ox-pushed machine was forgotten. From time
to time in recent years this machine has been reinvented
and a machine similar in principle is used
to-day to gather clover seed.</p>

<p>The scythe was a distinct improvement over the
sickle. It enabled a man to use two hands at the
work of reaping instead of one. It provided a much
longer and heavier blade, and hence a much
broader swath was cut at each stroke. A distinctly
American improvement on the scythe is the grain
cradle, consisting of a set of fingers above the blade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
which catch the grain and lay it in a swath at the
end of the stroke. This important improvement
rapidly spread to all parts of the world and is still
used to-day where it is impracticable to use a mechanical
reaper. It is claimed that one man can cut
and bind more grain with the cradle than three
men could with the sickle.</p>

<h3>EVOLUTION OF THE PLOW</h3>

<p>The plow has undergone important developments
in comparatively recent years. Wooden plows were
still in use in America in Revolutionary times; usually
the point was shod with wrought iron. However,
these wooden plows speedily gave way to
metal when iron came to be manufactured in considerable
quantity in this country. A plow has to
contend with two conditions of service that apparently
conflict with each other. The constant friction
of the soil against the blade tends to wear it
away very rapidly, hence a very hard surface is
requisite. On the other hand, the plow is apt to
encounter buried stones and rocks which will shatter
it unless it is soft. The problem then is to make
the plow both hard and soft. The chilled iron plow
was invented by Oliver, in 1855, to meet the first
condition. When molten iron is poured into an iron
mold the surface that comes into contact with the
mold is suddenly chilled, producing a very hard surface
that takes a good polish. This effect is accentuated
by using a hollow mold through which
water is circulated. The hard surface of the chilled
iron wears well in sandy and gravelly soil, it does
not rust deeply, and it clears well in sticky soil.
However, it is very brittle and is liable to break
if struck a sharp blow. A more recent improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
is the soft-center steel plow. This is both
hard and soft. It is composed of three layers of
metal; the outer layers are of hard cast steel and
the center one of soft steel. These metal layers are
heated to a welding heat and then rolled together,
producing a plow that has a hard outer wearing
surface and at the same time is tough because the
center layer of soft steel acts as a cushion to absorb
sharp blows. To increase the wearing qualities of
the plow still further a patch of very hard cast
steel is welded over the point of the share. Thus
both conflicting requirements of softness and extreme
hardness are met.</p>

<p>We think of the plow as a very simple tool, but
the modern implement is a product resulting from a
vast amount of study and research into the materials
most suitable for its construction and into
the best form of share and moldboard. In place
of a single plow for all purposes the modern farmer
is offered a large assortment to suit various classes
of work. At least three different kinds of plows are
indispensable on every farm; the sod plow, the
stubble plow, and the corn-cultivating plow. The sod
plow is used for turning over the sod and breaking
the clod. This is provided with a jointer or diminutive
plow point set above the share, which turns
over the edge of the furrow to prevent grass from
growing up between the furrows. The stubble plow
has a moldboard with less twist than that of the
sod plow. This is used for plowing land that was
under cultivation during the previous year.</p>

<p>The plow of to-day has become more than a hand-guided,
horse-drawn tool. It has developed into a
real machine, mounted on wheels, with a disk or
coulter wheel that cuts the furrow cleanly, means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for leveling the plow and regulating the depth of
the plow, and a seat for the plowman. It works
upon soil with the same precision that a planer works
upon a slab of cast iron. The furrow is neatly sliced,
lifted, and turned over with mechanical accuracy.
As the furrow slice slides over the moldboard
of the plow the soil is pulverized by friction.
The front furrow wheel runs in the furrow previously
cut which serves as a track to guide the machine.
The front and rear furrow wheels are inclined
from the vertical so as to balance the thrust
of the plow and they may be given a lead toward or
from the “land” or unplowed part of the ground to
regulate the steering automatically. The proper adjustment
and balancing of a plow calls for considerable
skill.</p>

<p>Agricultural operations are now conducted on
such a vast scale that the single plow cannot begin
to do the necessary work. Instead, sets of gang
plows are used so that from a dozen to two dozen
furrows may be turned at a time. Steam or gasoline
tractors of the wheel or track-laying type are
required to furnish the tractive effort needed to
haul these huge plows. The larger tractors are so
powerful that they haul not only the plow but a
harrow behind the plow to break up the clods and
a seeder behind the harrow to sow and cover the
seed so that all three operations are performed
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The disk type of plow is used in very dry and
hard soil and also in very sticky soil. A rolling disk
takes the place of the moldboard and share, and
in this way friction is reduced very materially,
with the result that less tractive effort is required
to draw the machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>There is scarcely any agricultural operation for
which a machine has not been designed. We cannot
attempt to describe them all. For tilling the
soil there are plows, harrows, drags, and rollers of
many different varieties; for seeding and planting
there are grain and seed drills, corn planters,
potato planters, etc.; for cultivating or working
the growing crops there are cultivators, weeders,
fertilizer drills, corn plows, etc.; and for harvesting
or gathering the crops there are mowers, hay
rakes and tedders, reapers and binders, potato diggers,
corn binders and huskers, corn shellers, etc.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE REAPER</h3>

<p>Most interesting of all are the reapers because
they represent the first successful efforts to introduce
machinery into farming operations. Toward
the close of the eighteenth century the Royal Agricultural
Society of England offered a prize for the
invention of a successful reaper, which stimulated
inventive effort in this field. But although many
patents on reaping machines were granted by the
British patent office, nothing was produced that
completely met the requirements. In fact even as
late as 1851 when a World’s Fair was held in London
the British had no really successful reaper to
exhibit. In the meantime, American inventors had
been at work and two inventors in particular, Obed
Hussey of Maryland and Cyrus McCormick of Virginia,
had developed machines which had so far
proved their worth that they were extensively used
on American farms. These two inventors, working
independently, produced machines that were very
similar in basic principles. As our patent regulations
of that period did not call for an extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
search of the prior art there was no official investigation
to show which was entitled to the honor of
priority of basic principles or whether both did not
include in their applications much that was old.
Hussey filed his patent on the last day of 1833 and
McCormick in June of 1834.</p>

<p>The main stumblingblocks of earlier inventors
of reaping and mowing machines was in finding
a suitable method of cutting the grain. Revolving
combs for tearing off the heads of grain, fingers for
gathering the grain and holding it against a revolving
cutter, horizontally reciprocating knives&mdash;all
these methods were tried without success. Nearly
three years before Hussey obtained his patent,
Manning, of Plainfield, New Jersey, solved the problem
by inventing a reciprocating cutter with spear-shaped
blades cooperating with a finger bar that
guided and held the grain against the blades. This
invention was apparently unknown to either
Hussey or McCormick and their patents show cutting
means that were broadly the same as that of
Manning.</p>

<h3>THE “FULTON” OF AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY</h3>

<p>Of the two rivals, McCormick showed the better
business ability in perfecting his invention and promoting
it so that he eventually became to be considered
the “Fulton” of agricultural machinery and
the public forgot the pioneer work of Hussey. As
a matter of fact, McCormick built his first successful
reaper three years before he obtained his
patent. Four horses were hitched to the machine
and he went out into a neighboring field of oats
to demonstrate it. In less than half a day he
had reaped six acres, which was a remarkable performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
when we consider that a single acre was
considered a day’s work for one man. McCormick’s
machine had a reel above the cutter to hold the
grain against the knife and as the grain was cut
it dropped upon a platform. A man walked alongside
the machine and removed the grain with a
rake. And so the reaper with two men to operate
it did the work that had formerly required twelve
men with the cradle.</p>

<p>The next important improvement was to provide
a seat at one side of the reaper so that the man with
the rake could ride. While this reduced the labor of
the man it did not materially increase the efficiency
of the machine. The next step, however, was of
material importance. In place of raking off the hay
by hand an automatic rake was furnished and the
services of the extra man were dispensed with. One
man could then do the work of twelve. McCormick
had had difficulty in introducing his machine into
public use, but now its superiority over hand labor
was so marked that reapers came to be extensively
employed on American farms. The reaper had
reached this stage of its development when the
World’s Fair of 1851 was held in London and McCormick’s
machine was sent across the Atlantic to
be displayed at the exhibition. At the same time
Hussey sent over one of his machines which had
reached the same stage of development. There was
a British machine also on exhibition based on the
invention of Rev. Patrick Bell of Scotland in 1826,
but in a competition with the American machines
it could not begin to compare in efficiency. The work
of the American machines was a revelation to the
British farmers. The prize was carried off by McCormick’s
machine, which was declared by the judges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to be worth the whole cost of the exposition. Unfortunately
Hussey was not on hand to direct the
operation of his machine, which may have had something
to do with its failure, for in another test the
Hussey reaper was found superior to the McCormick.</p>

<p>The excellence of American reapers was now well
established and their fame spread throughout
Europe. In a competitive test held near Paris in
1855, America won the highest honors by cutting
an acre of oats in twenty-two minutes as against
sixty-six minutes for a British machine and seventy-two
for an Algerian machine. In 1878 McCormick
was made a member of the French Academy of
Sciences in honor of his achievements.</p>

<h3>TYING KNOTS BY MACHINE</h3>

<p>After the self-raker was introduced the next important
improvement was in the binding of the
grain. At first the cut grain was raked into a
receptacle which was dumped by the driver of the
machine when enough had accumulated to form a
bundle and the bundles were bound by men following
the machine. As in the evolution of the raker,
the next step was to provide a platform for these
men on the machine so that they could ride as they
bound the grain and finally in 1873 a self-binding
attachment was invented which increased the
efficiency of the machine manifold. This self-binder,
however, called for the use of wire which did not
meet with favor as a binding material because of
the difficulty of cutting it without a special tool.
Efforts were therefore made to introduce twine
instead. But twine cannot be fastened by mere
twisting; it has to be tied and a mechanical means
of tying a knot was far from an easy problem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
solve. While it is true that the human body is a
machine and every movement of which it is capable
may be reproduced by mechanical means, the difficulty
is to copy many operations without involving
such complexity of members as to make the mechanism
wholly impracticable. The human hand is really
a very intricate piece of mechanism which by long
generations of evolution and development has become
wonderfully deft. It exhibits this deftness and
complexity of movement in tying knots and the very
intricacy of this operation was enough to baffle the
majority of inventors. There was one inventor,
however, who was not to be thwarted even by so
formidable an obstacle as this. In 1864 Jacob Behel
secured a patent on an attachment for binders
which would actually tie a knot. The mechanism
passed the twine around the gavel of grain, formed
a loop in the two ends, and tied a simple overhand
knot in much the same way that the hand ties this
knot. Ten years later Marquis L. Gorham improved
the mechanism and built a successful twine binder.
Finally in 1879 John F. Appleby perfected the
binding mechanism, completing the last stage in the
development of the modern automatic self-binding
reaper.</p>

<p>To keep pace with the reaper, other agricultural
machines had to be invented and developed. The
vast quantity of grain harvested could not be
threshed by hand and the old-fashioned flail had to
give way to the steam-driven threshing machine.
Finally to meet the requirements of the vast western
wheat fields, the combined harvester and
thresher was developed which, with a crew of four
men, will reap, thresh, and bag between two and
three thousand bushels per day. According to statistics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the U. S. Department of Agriculture it
took a man three hours and a half to produce a
bushel of wheat in 1830 as against ten minutes in
1896. Surely the world owes a tremendous debt to
Hussey and particularly to McCormick for introducing
machinery into agriculture and starting the
train of inventions which in the space of two-thirds
of a century have led up to the present remarkable
era of machine farming.</p>

<p>There still remains one task of the farmer that
has not yet been accomplished with unqualified success
by machine. The harvesting of the corn crop
is a tedious and disagreeable task and one which the
farmer would only too gladly turn over to the machine.
To be sure, many corn-harvesting machines
have been built and put into service with more or
less success, but none has reached the perfection of
other classes of agricultural machinery. The difficulty
lies not in the machine, but in the fact that
corn is so easily beaten down by storms that at
harvest time the machine seldom finds the stalks all
standing up in nice straight rows. Machines must
therefore be provided with means for lifting up the
fallen stalks to vertical position. The stalks are cut
and bound into bundles and stood up in shocks.</p>

<p>Even more difficult than cutting and binding is
the task of husking the corn. This work was always
dreaded by farm hands, but now machines are provided
to husk the ears and shred the stalks for fodder.
Thus the farm is being relieved of its drudgery.
Unfortunately it is only the large western farms
that can afford to avail themselves of the latest
agricultural machinery. On small eastern farms it
does not pay to purchase a machine which can be
used for only a few weeks in the year and then must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
be stored away until the next season, but small
farmers are now cooperating and clubbing together
to buy the less frequently used machines and so
even the small farm is being relieved of its drudgery,
and the arduous burdens which have always had a
tendency to drive young men away from the farm
are now being assumed by the unfeeling machine.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">MACHINING THE EARTH</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE ALBANIAN people have a story that the
Creator recently visited the earth and was astonished
to find how it had changed. “Why, this is
not the earth I created,” He said. “Everything has
changed. My forests are cut down; My rivers have
been diverted from their courses; My hills have
been blasted away, and My mountains have been
robbed of their minerals. The whole face of the
earth has been altered.” But in the course of His
roamings, the Creator suddenly came upon the
land of Albania. “Ah!” He exclaimed in delight.
“Here is a bit of earth untouched by man. It is
still just as I made it.”</p>

<p>Man’s ambition to make over the face of the
earth to his own liking dates far back of the
present age of machinery. However, the work of
the ancient engineer was accomplished only at the
expense of decades and generations of hard manual
labor. To-day, with powerful and gigantic machinery
to do our bidding, we do not hesitate to change
the course of rivers, to level off the hills, to carve
highways through the mountains and pierce them
with tunnels, to bore into their depths for treasure
and drive deep holes into the bowels of the earth
in quest of liquid fuel. We are able to machine the
earth in much the same way as a piece of metal is
machined in the machine shop. In fact, the drill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the circular saw, the slotter, and even the milling
machine have their counterpart in the excavating
machinery of to-day. Of course we cannot expect
to find the counterpart of such machines as the
lathe, boring mill, and planer, in which the work revolves
against the tool, because this planet of ours
is rather too big a piece of stock to be placed between
lathe centers or to be bolted to a planer bed.</p>

<h3>MECHANICAL MONSTERS</h3>

<p>The twentieth century finds this planet again
stocked with monsters larger and more powerful
than the gigantic saurians that dominated the earth
in the Jurassic and Cretaceous epochs, but our
mighty fire-breathing, steel-sinewed beasts are
humbly subservient to the will of man.</p>

<p>The spectacle of a large steam shovel at work
makes one feel at once very small and very big.
Before the work of this monster the human shoveler
shrinks to the proportions of a mere insect.
Seven to eight cubic yards shoveled into a cart
is considered a fair day’s work for a laborer, but
a big steam shovel can easily gobble up as much
material in two bites. However, when we contemplate
that this mammoth machine is a human
creation and an absolute slave to human command,
we are rather inclined to be puffed up with the
greatness of man.</p>

<p>Steam shovels are ideal machines for excavating
railroad cuts and were primarily developed for just
such work. The general operation of the machine
is very similar to that of hand shoveling. The
shovel proper consists of a big scoop or dipper and
a dipper handle which correspond respectively to
the blade and handle of a hand shovel. Like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
shovel, the dipper is supported at two points. The
dipper is suspended by a chain from the end of a
boom while the handle of the dipper is also supported
in the boom. By loosening the hoisting chain
the dipper is lowered to the ground, and by moving
the handle forward the toothed cutting edge is
made to bite into the ground or sand bank. The
hoisting chain then hauls up the dipper, making it
scoop out the bank, after which it is swung to one
side over a car on an adjoining track. The rear of
the bucket is fitted with a door which is opened by
a spring latch and the contents are emptied out.
Some of the largest steam shovels for ordinary
grading have dippers with a capacity of 5 cubic
yards. They are not confined to railroad grading,
but are applicable to any excavation where a firm
footing is provided for the heavy machine. They
are even used for excavating the cellars of large
city buildings. The machine must be supported on
road wheels or on skids. When used for excavating
sewer trenches, it is sometimes mounted on a platform
spanning the trench. However, the steam
shovel is rather limited in its reach. The largest
ordinary steam shovels have a clear lift of but sixteen
feet and can make a cut only sixty feet wide
at the top.</p>

<p>For more extensive excavating as well as for digging
ditches and trenches the drag-line excavator
has recently come in to use. In these machines a
scraper takes the place of the dipper. This is suspended
from the end of a long crane and it is
dragged along the ground by a cable, scooping up
a load of earth. In some cases the scoop or scraper
is merely attached to a cable leading from the hoisting
engine to an anchorage and back to the engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
To adapt excavating machines for service in soft
ground they are mounted on broad wheels or on
track-laying tractor surfaces. One peculiar form
of walking traction used by a drag-line excavator
was described in Chapter XIII.</p>

<h3>DITCHING AND TRENCHING MACHINES</h3>

<p>For digging narrow ditches and trenches, particularly
for sewers, water mains, gas-pipe lines,
etc., a number of very interesting machines have
been invented which are of two general types, the
endless chain and the wheel excavators. The first
type consists of a traction engine with a ladder at
the rear that drops down into the trench. About
this ladder runs an endless chain which carries a
series of scoops or buckets. These are dragged up
against the breast of the work and carry the excavated
earth to the top of the ladder where it is
dumped upon a transverse belt conveyor and
carried to one side of the trench. With the larger
sizes of chain excavators, trenches may be dug to a
depth of twenty feet and the width of the trench
may be from two to six feet wide.</p>

<p>The wheel type of trenching machine is similar
in principle to the chain excavator. Instead of the
chain of buckets, it has a wheel fitted with buckets.
In one prominent type the wheel has no hub or
spokes, but consists of a rim that is supported on and
is turned by four friction rollers mounted in a rigid
frame. This frame is mounted on a boom which
can be raised or lowered as desired. Such machines
can commonly dig to a depth of a dozen feet or so.</p>

<p>A ditch differs from a trench in the fact that its
side walls are sloping instead of vertical. A trench
is usually a temporary excavation for the laying of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
pipes or conduits while the ditch is left open and
serves for irrigation or drainage. There are chain
ditching machines in which the chain of buckets
runs laterally across the course of the ditch, dipping
into the earth to form a V-shaped channel. In
connection with the draining of the Everglades of
Florida, a peculiar wheel type of ditcher was built.
The wheel is of gigantic proportions, consisting of
a series of radiating shovels or scoops shaped to
conform to the outline of the ditch. As the wheel
revolves it scoops up the mud which slides down
toward the hub of the wheel and is carried to one
side by a traveling conveyor.</p>

<h3>FLOATING EXCAVATORS</h3>

<p>The main difficulty in drainage work is to provide
a good footing for the machine which must
necessarily be very heavy. Broad caterpillar tread
surfaces are about the only means of locomotion.
In very soft swampy regions dredges have to be
used. Dredges are merely floating excavators. In
them the problem of support and locomotion disappear
and there are no limitations of size and
weight to be considered. Floating excavators are
therefore much more powerful than excavators
that run on land. The ordinary dipper dredge is
merely a floating steam shovel with a much longer
dipper handle and much larger dipper. When work
on the slides of the Panama Canal had proceeded
far enough to admit of using dredges in place of
steam shovels material progress was made. Two
enormous dipper dredges were built, each provided
with a dipper that had a capacity of fifteen cubic
yards or about twenty tons at a single lift. The
dipper was big enough to hold thirty men. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dipper handle was seventy-two feet long and it could
reach down to a depth of fifty feet. A smaller dipper
of ten cubic yards capacity was also provided. The
power of these huge dredges was illustrated when
one of them, while using its ten-yard bucket, picked
up an enormous bowlder weighing forty tons. It was
much bigger than the dipper that had raised it and
it was far too big to be placed on the mud scow that
was receiving the spoil brought up by the dredge.
Had it been rolled off on the scow it would have
crashed right through the bottom of the boat and so
the big rock had to be drilled and broken up on the
dipper before it could be dumped into the scow.</p>

<p>For work on a soft bottom, grab buckets are
used in place of dippers. These may be made of
two scoops as in the clam-shell bucket or of four
leaves as in the orange-peel bucket. No rigid handle
is provided for these scoops. They are spread open
as they are lowered into the water and on hauling
in the hoisting cable, the scoops or leaves come together
biting into the bottom and lifting up a load
of mud. Grab buckets are largely used for picking
up coal, ore, gravel, etc.</p>

<p>The equivalent of the chain trench-digging machine
is found in the ladder dredge. A ladder is
hung over the stern of the dredge and carries a
chain of buckets which dig into the bottom and
bring up the mud or sand.</p>

<h3>GOLD MINING WITH A DREDGE</h3>

<p>It is a dredge of this type that is put to the peculiar
task of gold mining. The dredge eats its way into
gold-bearing sands, the material passing through
a system of separators which extract the gold and
then being discharged at the rear of the dredge.
The dredge floats in a pool of water that it carries
with it, for as it excavates ahead it builds up sand
banks behind. In this way it may travel far from
the river from which it first started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUCTION DREDGES</h3>

<p>Suction dredges are particularly adapted for excavating
sandy bottoms. One type used for dredging
channels consists of a large steam vessel with
large bins into which the dredged material is
pumped. At each side of the boat there is a long
pipe which may be let down into the water. Each
pipe terminates in a drag or footpiece with grated
opening which is designed to be dragged along the
bottom as the vessel slowly steams ahead. Powerful
pumps suck a stream of water up the pipes
which carries with it a quantity of sand. The sand
and water flow into the bins, the solid matter settling
to the bottom while the liquid flows out over
the top. When the settlings have filled the tanks,
the drags are pulled up and the vessel steams out
to sea. Here doors in the bottom of the bins are
opened and the material drops through. The idea
of opening up the bottom of a boat to empty it
seems rather startling until we consider that the
bins are sealed off from the rest of the boat and
do not contribute to its buoyancy. The sand that is
dumped out of them is much heavier than the water
that takes its place when the bin doors are opened.</p>

<h3>CANAL DIGGING UNDER WATER</h3>

<p>The Ambrose channel in lower New York Bay
was dredged by means of suction dredges. The
channel is forty feet deep at low water and the
bottom had to be excavated from ten to twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
feet to attain this depth. About seventy million
cubic yards of material had to be excavated or
nearly a third as much as was excavated in the
Panama Canal. The Ambrose channel is seven miles
long while the Panama Canal is forty-five miles in
length. Two of the larger dredges each had a capacity
of forty-five hundred cubic yards in their bins
or enough to load a train about a mile long, composed
of 175 cars. It took less than three hours to
fill the bins. The openings in the gratings of the
drags measured about eight by nine inches and any
stones or solid matter small enough to pass through
them was easily sucked up into the bins. When a
pile of stones of larger diameter was encountered
a deep hole was dredged around it and then by means
of a water jet the stones were forced into the hole.</p>

<p>The material sucked up by a dredge is sometimes
dumped into a scow alongside. This makes the
structure of the dredge less expensive, but where
work has to be conducted in bodies of water exposed
to storms it is more expedient to let the
dredge collect the material within its own hull.</p>

<h3>LAND BUILDING WITH DREDGES</h3>

<p>The sand drawn up by a suction dredge is valuable
material for land building. In fact, a suction
dredge is often used for the double purpose of excavating
and filling in low land. Sometimes its only
purpose is to fill in tide flats to above tide level. The
material is discharged through a pipe line which
may be over a mile in length. This pipe line is supported
on a string of wooden or steel pontoons. The
pipe sections are connected by means of heavy
rubber sleeves so as to make the line flexible. This
permits the dredge to move about and also allows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of moving the discharge end about to distribute the
sand properly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately all dredging does not consist of
sand and mud. Sometimes snags and matted roots
are encountered which give trouble. For handling
such material rotary cutters are used. The bow of the
dredge is fitted with a hinged ladder about sixty to
seventy feet long in which the cutter is mounted.
The ladder also carries the suction pipe close to the
cutter. The ladder is lowered to the bottom and
the revolving cutter chops up the roots into pieces
which are drawn up into the suction pipe. The
size of the pieces that are sometimes sucked up is
remarkable. The greater part of the area of the
New Orleans Inner Harbor Navigation Canal was
filled with stumps and matted cypress roots. The
cutters tore up and cut these roots and stumps and
the pieces were transported through a pipe line
about 600 feet long. Stumps that were too large to
be handled in this way were undercut and sunk below
grade.</p>

<p>Cutters are used also for loosening packed hard bottoms
and some of them will dig into hard pan and even
soft rock. A pressure of 100 to 150 pounds per square
inch is maintained in a discharge pipe twenty to
twenty-four inches in diameter, which is enough to
carry along heavy bowlders dug up by the cutter.</p>

<h3>THE DEEPEST MINE SHAFT</h3>

<p>So far we have dealt only with surface conditions,
but man has not been content to stay on the surface
of this planet. True, we have scarcely begun to
explore the crust of the earth. The deepest mine
in the world is the Morro Velho in the province of
Minas Geraes, Brazil. Here the earth has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
penetrated to a depth of 6,426 feet in quest of gold.
This is a depth of less than a mile and a quarter
and it shrinks into insignificance when we reflect
that we must go more than 3,000 times that distance
to reach the center of the earth. However,
we have made material progress in shaft-sinking
in recent years, and it is quite likely that the lure
of scientific research may prove even more powerful
than that of gold and that some day we shall be
induced to dig many miles into the crust of the
earth just to learn something more about this globe
that whirls us through space.</p>

<p>We have not yet reached the point at which hand
labor may be dispensed with in tunnel work, but
there are machines which will do what formerly
could only be accomplished with the manually
wielded pick and shovel. We have already (in
Chapter VII) described the pneumatic tunnel
shield and explained how it is sometimes driven
forward through soft silt by means of hydraulic
jacks without any excavation of material. This
method of tunneling which is analogous to driving
a punch through soft metal, has a very limited field
of application. It is impossible to force the shield
in this manner through sand or through any but
very soft silt.</p>

<h3>TUNNELING BY MACHINE</h3>

<p>The city of Cleveland takes its drinking water
from Lake Erie. In order to obtain water that is
not contaminated by the refuse of the city, tunnels
are carried out under the bottom of the lake about
two miles from the shore where they terminate in
water intakes far enough below the surface to
avoid floating impurities and far enough above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
bottom to avoid impurities that have settled to the
lake bed. The material through which the tunnels
pass is a stiff clay, that cuts like cheese. So uniform
is this material that a special machine was built
to bore the tunnel through it. This machine is somewhat
similar to a boring mill. It has an arm that
revolves against the face of the tunnel heading and
carries a cutter that travels along the arm so that
it cuts a continuous spiral ribbon of clay. The clay
ribbon passes back through the machine and is
loaded into a train of dump cars.</p>

<p>For boring tunnels in hard rock many different
machines have been invented, but not one of them
as yet has proved an unqualified success. One very
interesting machine, which was tried on the New
York subway excavation at 42d Street and Lexington
Avenue, consisted of a series of chipping hammers
which, by means of pneumatic mechanism, were
made to hammer and pulverize the face of the rock
with repeated blows. The hammers were arranged
in a circle and were revolved as they hammered
so that the whole surface of the heading was attacked
and a circular tunnel was cut through the
rock. A serious disadvantage under which the machine
labored was the fact that the rock had to be
crushed to a powder or into small chips before it
could be removed.</p>

<p>In ordinary rock excavation holes are bored into
the heading and the rock is then blown out by
means of dynamite or some other explosive. Large
fragments of rock are then broken up into pieces
small enough to be handled readily, but no energy
is wasted in reducing the material to a powder. The
percussion drills with which the rock is bored have
already been briefly described. When boring holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
for a blast in soft material, such as bituminous coal,
a drill is used which resembles in many respects
an ordinary twisted auger bit except that it is many
feet in length. It is driven by hand into the coal
by the use of a common bit brace. Percussion drills
or punches are also used. These are driven either
by pneumatic or electric power.</p>

<h3>COAL-CUTTING MACHINERY</h3>

<p>When excavating coal the heading is first undercut,
that is, a deep slot is cut in the wall of coal
along the floor line. Then blast holes are bored into
the coal above this cut so that when the charges are
fired the coal will be broken downward. To undercut
the coal special machines are used, driven by
compressed air or electricity. These have endless
chains fitted with chisel or pick points that bite into
and cut the coal. After the material has been shattered
and reduced to fragments of convenient size
special machinery may be employed to shovel it
away from the heading and into dump cars. One
electrically driven shoveling machine which was
tried out on some of the Catskill aqueduct excavation
had a broad open shovel which could be driven
into the pile of rock fragments under the control
of an operator and would scoop up the material,
delivering it upon a traveling belt conveyor which
carried it on to the train cars. Many types of
mechanical shoveling and loading machines have
been built for use in mines. They are driven either
by pneumatic or electric power.</p>

<h3>EXPLORING SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS</h3>

<p>In all engineering work it is highly important
to explore subsurface conditions before starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
any construction or even drawing up plans. The
ordinary pneumatic percussion drill will not serve
for deep holes. Instead a rotary boring motion is
requisite. The tool is mounted with black diamond
cutters which cut through the hardest rock. Water
is introduced into the hole to lubricate the tool and
also to wash out the abraded material. By trapping
this material the character of the rock penetrated
may be determined. The material, however,
is pulverized and does not furnish, as a general
rule, a fair sample of the rock. When it is highly
important to determine the exact nature of the rock
or other material a core drill is used. In other
words the drill is a hollow tube set with cutting
crystals about its periphery. As the tool is revolved
it cuts an annular slot in the rock leaving a central
core standing. This core is broken off and drawn
to the surface and furnishes a true sample of the
material encountered by the drill.</p>

<p>There is an interesting type of core drill in which
steel shot is used in place of diamonds. The cutting
end of the drill is a collar with a notched edge.
Steel balls are fed into the drill and under the
cutting head. The balls are caught in the notches
and rolled around against the rock surface. There
is also a partial dragging action. The friction is
sufficient to wear away the rock. As the balls wear
away they are replaced with new ones. Very evidently
such drilling costs less for upkeep than
diamond drilling, but it is not as rapid as the latter.</p>

<h3>LOCATING ROCK UNDER HUDSON RIVER</h3>

<p>A notable illustration of exploration drilling was
furnished by the surveys for the Hudson crossing
of the Catskill Aqueduct. To bring water from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Catskill Mountains to New York City it was necessary
to cross the Hudson River. In order to furnish
a permanent conduit it was decided to carry
the water in an inverted siphon bored through
solid rock. It was necessary to obtain a profile of
the rock at the point where a crossing seemed most
feasible. Borings were therefore made from a
barge anchored in the river, but it was impossible
with such an unsteady working base to carry on
the boring to any considerable depth. Tides, the
wash of passing steamers, floating ice, all combined
to obstruct the work. Drills were constantly broken.
Finally it was decided to do the boring from opposite
banks of the river at such an angle that
bore holes would meet or pass each other under the
middle of the river. The exploration boring from
the barges indicated that solid rock lay at a considerable
depth below the river bed and that the
bore holes would have to be set at a sharp angle to
keep from breaking through rock. The river at that
point is about 3,000 feet wide and a boring from
the surface at the middle of the river had been
driven to a depth of 768 feet without striking solid
rock. Two shafts were sunk to a depth of about
250 feet and from these diamond drill borings were
started at such an angle that they would cross at
a depth of 1,500 feet. Excellent rock was encountered
throughout the boring. Then a second set of
borings was made which crossed at a depth of 950
feet without encountering any appreciable amount
of water. It was accordingly decided to carry the
aqueduct in vertical shafts, one at each side of the
river, at a depth of 1,100 feet below water level,
and then connect these shafts with a horizontal tunnel.
It was important to have a good solid rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cover over the tunnel because the aqueduct reaches
the river with a head of 400 feet which added to
the 1,100 feet of depth of the inverted siphon gave
a total head of 1,500 feet or a hydraulic pressure of
about forty-two tons per square inch.</p>

<p>Although the diamond drill borings just mentioned
were remarkable because of their inclination
and because of the cramped quarters from which
they were driven, they do not begin to compare in
depth with some of the borings made in search of
water and of oil. The deepest boring in the world
to date is near Fairmount, West Virginia, where a
hole six inches in diameter was driven to a depth of
7,579 feet or nearly a mile and a half. At that
point an earth slide stopped further borings.</p>

<h3>BORING FOR OIL</h3>

<p>The time-honored method of boring for oil
known as the percussive system is to hammer
through the earth and rock with a heavy steel drill.
The drill really consists of a long string of parts
measuring altogether as much as sixty feet in
length. (See Figure 64.) The drill proper or bit has
a cutting edge adapted for the character of the material
it is to penetrate. The bit is attached to a steel
bar known as the “auger stem” which may be from
twelve to forty-five feet in length. Then come the
“jars” or a link member which allows a play of
about sixteen inches. The purpose of this is to assist
in freeing the bit from the material it is penetrating
by jarring it upward on the upstroke of the drill.
Above the jars there is another bar known as the
sinker, and this is provided with a rope socket to
which is attached the cable that carries the string
of drill parts. The cable passes over a pulley to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
walking beam which gives the necessary up-and-down
motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-286.jpg" width="250" height="458"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">FIG. 64.&mdash;A STRING OF WELL-DRILLING
TOOLS</p>
</div></div>

<p>The loose material in the bore is removed by a
sand pump. To protect the bore from caving a
casing of steel pipe must be lowered into the well.
The boring may proceed at the rate of ten to sixty
feet per day, depending upon the material penetrated
and the depth of the well. All sorts of difficulties
are liable to interrupt the work. The cable
may break, the string of tools may become unscrewed,
or the casing may drop into the hole, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
then follows the tedious process of fishing for the
lost parts and hauling them up out of the well.</p>

<p>As the drilling proceeds, the bore becomes progressively
smaller and casings of smaller diameter
must be used. The well is completed by lowering a
pipe within the casing through which the oil flows to
the surface and is carried to the storage tanks and
thence by pipe lines to the refineries.</p>

<p>While the percussive system of drilling is very
generally used throughout the American oil fields,
rotary methods of drilling are largely employed in
California.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">FROM FIBER TO FABRIC</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT IS NOT very long since the spinning wheel and
the clacking loom were an indispensable furnishing
of every farmhouse and of many city dwellings
as well. With infinite patience the fleece of
sheep, the lint of flax, the filaments of silk and the
fibers of cotton were spun into yarn and then
woven into cloth, and it was the nimble fingers of
the housewife that carried the process through from
the matted raw product to the finished garment.</p>

<p>It is comparatively easy to comprehend the development
of machines for dealing with such gross
material as earth, rock, iron, and wood, but when
we come to consider the infinitely delicate and almost
imponderable fibers that go to make up our
textiles, the marvel is that any but highly skilled
human hands, guided by keen eyesight, could combine
the tangled and obstreperous filaments into
fine yarn and weave this yarn into complicated patterns
of cloth. But the spinning wheel and hand
loom could not stand long in the path of power-driven
machinery, and now huge, blind machines,
with stiff, unbending fingers of metal, comb out
the matted masses of raw material, remove the dirt
and twigs, straighten out the snarls far quicker
and better than could be done by hand, and transform
the fibers into beautiful fabrics such as in
former days would have been the envy of kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot attempt to describe all the machinery
involved in the spinning and weaving of yarn, but
it is highly important that every well-informed
person have a general knowledge of textile machinery.
Because cotton cloth is more widely used than
either linen or wool, we shall confine ourselves to
the cotton branch of the textile industry, particularly
as the difference between the treatment of
cotton and other textile materials lies chiefly in the
preparation of the thread or yarn.</p>

<p>The predominance of cotton among textiles may
be traced back to the invention of a young New
Englander fresh from college, who went to Georgia
as a private tutor, only to find when he got there
that some one else had been engaged in his stead,
leaving him stranded and practically penniless in
a strange land. We had occasion to refer to this
man in Chapter III. Eli Whitney was a born mechanic,
and before entering college had not only
shown great skill but had actually built up a thriving
business in the manufacture of nails, hatpins
and knife blades.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE COTTON GIN</h3>

<p>The agricultural condition of Georgia and its
neighboring States at the time that Whitney arrived
there was very poor. There was no market
for their products. A splendid cotton, with fibers
from 1⅜ to 2½ inches long, was growing on the
islands along the coast, but this cotton could not
be raised inland. The upland product, known as
“green seed” cotton, had a fiber only half as long
as the “Sea Island” cotton, but the principal drawback
to its use was the difficulty of separating
the fiber from the seed. It was a day’s work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
for one woman to separate a single pound of the
“green seed” cotton fiber.</p>

<p>His attention having been brought to this matter,
Whitney undertook to design a machine which
would remove the fiber from the seed in a small
fraction of the time required by hand labor. He
was visiting at the time at the plantation of Mrs.
Greene, widow of General Nathaniel Greene, of
Revolutionary fame, and he set himself to the task
with such limited materials and tools as he could
find on the estate. In a couple of weeks he had
built a model which contained all the essentials of
the modern cotton gin, with which a single man
could separate more cotton in a day than could be
produced by hand in a whole season. This was in
the winter of 1792. The effect of the invention
was felt immediately. Cotton production had been
falling off steadily. In 1791, 189,316 pounds of
cotton had been exported. The next year there was
a falling off to 138,328 pounds, but following the
introduction of the cotton gin exports rose to
487,000 pounds in 1793, 1,681,000 in 1794, and
6,276,000 in 1795. Fifty years later the world production
amounted to 1,169,600,000, nearly seven-eighths
of which was contributed by the United
States, and of this only a small amount was Sea
Island cotton.</p>

<p>A cotton gin (Fig. 65) consists of a gang of circular
saws (<i>A</i>), with forwardly pointed teeth which
pass between the ribs of an inclined grating (<i>B</i>)
that forms the floor of a chamber (<i>C</i>) known as a
roll box. In this box is mounted a toothed roller
(<i>D</i>). The cotton is fed into the box and the fibers
are seized by the teeth of the saws and dragged
through the grating while the seeds, being too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
large to pass through, are left behind and, rolling
down the grating, drop into a hopper. The action
of the saws is such as to impart a rolling motion
to the mass of cotton, and hence to the roller in the
roll box. This tends to drag the cotton into the
roll box and bring fresh supplies to the saws. The
fleece carried by the saw teeth is beaten off by a
wheel (<i>E</i>) fitted with wire brushes. These brushes,
traveling in the same direction as the saw teeth,
but at a higher velocity, readily disengage the fibers
from the teeth and create an air blast that blows
the cotton fleece out of the gin.</p>

<h3>PREPARING COTTON FOR THE SPINNING MULE</h3>

<p>Cotton as it comes from the bale is a compact,
matted mass, mixed with bits of seed, leaves, sand,
and other impurities, and it must pass through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
number of machines before it comes out as a pure,
light, fleecy product, with the fibers combed parallel.
Even for a medium yarn a dozen machines are
required to prepare the cotton for the spinning
mule.</p>

<p>A system of “counts” is used to indicate the size
of yarn and it is based on the number of hanks
it takes to make a pound. A hank is always 840
yards and 50’s would mean that the yarn is of
such fineness that it would take 50 × 840 yards
(=4,200 yards) of it to weigh a pound. Yarn
below 30’s is graded as <i>coarse</i>; between 30’s and
60’s as <i>medium</i> and above 60’s as <i>fine</i>. To prepare
cotton as it comes from the bale for a fine
yarn of, say, 100’s, it must go through no less than
sixteen machines before it reaches the mule.</p>

<p>We have not the space to describe all of these
machines, but in general it will suffice to say that
the cotton is graded by passing it through a series
of pickers. These machines throw out the fibers
and beat them so as to knock out the impurities
and, at the same time, a blast of air blows out the
dust. The cotton is treated by a number of such
machines in succession and is finally delivered in
a broad sheet known as a “lap,” after which it
passes through the carding machine which combs
out the tangled bunches and removes further impurities
from the lap. The lap is then gathered
into a compact rope known as a “sliver.” The
sliver goes through the drawing rolls which serve
to parallelize the fibers and make the sliver of even
thickness, and at the same time to give a moderate
amount of twist so that it will hold together, and it
issues from the machine as “roving.” In the case
of fine yarn the sliver issuing from the carding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
machine goes through a combing machine so as to
remove the finer fibers. The bobbins of the roving
are then placed in the spinning machine, which
may be either the spinning mule or the ring spinning
machine. The principal difference between the two
is that the spinning mule is intermittent in its operation,
while the ring spinner not only spins the roving
into yarn but at the same time winds it up on
a bobbin.</p>

</div></div>

<h3>ARKWRIGHT’S DRAWING ROLLS</h3>

<p>The first advance over the old-fashioned spinning
wheel, which dates back to the fifteenth century,
was in 1770, when the first spinning jenny was invented
by Hargreaves. This consisted practically
of a multiple spinning wheel by which one man
could spin a large numbers of bobbins of yarn at
the same time. It was at about the same time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Arkwright invented the drawing rolls which have
played a most important part in the preparation
of yarn, and this invention is worthy of our attention
because it contains an interesting mechanical
principle. As shown in Figure 66, a number of
pairs of rolls are provided through which the roving
passes, but successive pairs operate at higher
velocities. Thus, the second pair of rollers through
which the roving passes run at a little higher speed
than the first pair, the third a little higher than the
second pair, and so on. As a result, the roving is
drawn out by the operation and issues from the
last pair of rollers at a higher speed than it entered
the first pair of rollers. The only way in which it
can accommodate itself to this accelerated motion
is to be attenuated or drawn out. Weights are used,
as shown in the drawing, to press the upper rollers
against the lower ones.</p>

<h3>THE SPINNING MULE</h3>

<p>Shortly after Arkwright’s invention came the
mule spinner, invented by Crompton between 1774
and 1779. Machines operated on the same general
principle as this are in general use to-day. In the
old-fashioned method of spinning by hand the
worker took a small quantity of cotton, pulled it
out into a long sliver, attached one end to a bobbin
and gave the bobbin a twirl between his hands in
order to spin the fiber into yarn; then the yarn was
wound up on the bobbin and the process was repeated.
The spinning mule does practically the
same thing, but infinitely faster and on a much
larger scale. As shown in Figure 67, the bobbins
of roving (<i>A</i>) are mounted on a stand and passed
through a set of drawing rolls (<i>B</i>) which are regulated
to pull the rovings out to the desired thickness
of yarn. The roving then passes to the nose
of a “cop,” or spindle (<i>C</i>), which is revolved at
very high speed. The cop is carried by a carriage
(<i>D</i>) which moves away from the bobbins of roving
to the position indicated by dotted lines, while
the cop is revolving. The cop has a travel of about
five feet during the time the yarn is drawn out and
spun. Then the carriage moves back toward the
stand upon which the bobbins of roving are
mounted and the spun yarn is wound up on the
cop. The reason the yarn does not wind up on
the cop while it is spinning is because it runs to
the nose of the cop and, at each turn of the cop,
the coil twists on the nose and slips off. On the
return of the carriage, however, a set of wires (<i>E</i>),
called “fallers,” press the yarn down so that the
revolving cop will wind up the slack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The continuously operating ring-spinning machine
is provided with a ring frame (Figure 68)
around the cop or spindle. This frame, together
with the spindle, revolves at high speed, but as the
ring revolves a little more slowly than the spindle
it winds the yarn comparatively slowly upon the
spindle or bobbin.</p>

<h3>WOVEN, BRAIDED, KNITTED, AND NET GOODS</h3>

<p>Having now produced our yarn, we may pause to
consider the different types of fabric into which it
may be formed, and to draw a distinction between,
woven, braided, knitted, and net goods. In weaving
we have two sets of threads, one set running
transversely to the other; in braided materials the
threads all run longitudinally and are arranged to
cross each other diagonally, so that they are interwoven;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in knitting and netting there is a single
thread. In the case of netting this thread is knotted
where it loops back upon itself, whereas in
knitting it is merely looped without knotting.</p>

<h3>THE LOOM</h3>

<p>The loom can trace its genealogy away back to
early Babylonian times, and the modern power-driven
machine does not differ in its broad principles
of operation from its ancient progenitor&mdash;the
hand loom.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">FIG. 69.&mdash;THE HEDDLES OF A LOOM</p>
</div></div>

<p>Every industry has a vocabulary of its own to
furnish names for its machine parts and products
peculiar unto itself, and in this respect the textile
industry is by no means an exception. The threads
that run lengthwise in a piece of woven cloth are
known as the “weft,” “woof” or “filling.” In the
loom the warp threads are threaded through loops
on what are known as “heddles”; in fact, there are
two “heddles,” <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, Figure 69. Alternate
warp threads (<i>C</i>) pass through the loops of one
heddle, and the other threads through the loops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
on the other heddle. When one heddle is raised
and the other lowered, the threads form a wedge-shaped
space (<i>D</i>) which is known as a “shed.”
The filling thread is sent through the shed and is
then pressed closely into the wedge-shaped space
against the cloth already woven by means of a
“reed” (<i>E</i>) which is a comblike member with teeth
or flat pieces of metal that pass between the warp
threads. This done, the position of the heddles is
reversed, so that <i>A</i> is now lowered and <i>B</i> raised,
thus binding the warp thread in place and forming
another shed for the next warp thread; and thus
the process continues.</p>

<p>The filling thread is placed in a shuttle (<i>F</i>)
which carries a bobbin on which the thread is
wound. As the shuttle is thrown back and forth
through the shed, the thread is unwound and trails
behind it. Formerly the shuttle was thrown back
and forth by hand, but years ago, long before the
invention of the steam engine, the flying shuttle
was invented. In other words, a mechanism was
provided for striking the shuttle a blow and throwing
it across the warp from side to side. By
this means the speed of operations was greatly
increased.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century the
drop box was invented. This consists of a receptacle
for shuttles carrying different colors of thread
which may be selected in a definite order and
thrown back and forth so as to vary the pattern
of the cloth.</p>

<p>In present looms a special machine is provided for
taking the threads from the bobbins or cops and
laying them in an even sheet to form the warp of
the loom. These are wound on a beam and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
machine is known as a <i>beam warper</i>. As the
threads are apt to be somewhat fuzzy it is necessary
to size them, and a machine known as a
<i>slasher</i> is employed for this purpose. This machine
coats each thread of warp yarn with a sizing compound
or an adhesive and dries the sheet of warp
preparatory to its use in the loom.</p>

<p>In common weaving the weft or filling threads
run alternately under and over the warp threads
with perfect regularity. A pattern can be formed
by passing the weft threads under and over alternate
groups of warp threads, and this is effected
in the ordinary loom by threading the weft in
groups through the heddles, <i>i. e.</i>, instead of having
every second thread pass through one heddle and
the intervening threads through the other heddle;
the threads are arranged in alternate groups of
two or more. This gives a regular pattern, but it
may be varied to form ornamental designs if the
groups are varied. Such designs used to be worked
out by hand very slowly and laboriously, with the
result that figured weaving was very expensive.</p>

<h3>THE JACQUARD LOOM</h3>

<p>At the French Exposition of 1801 a loom was
exhibited that made a sensation. With seemingly
human intelligence it selected individual warp
threads or groups of threads and raised them or
lowered them so as to work out elaborate ornamental
designs. The inventor, Joseph Marie Jacquard,
of Lyons, received a medal for his marvelous
invention and was decorated with the Cross of the
Legion of Honor.</p>

<p>The “brains” of the Jacquard loom is a set of
pasteboard cards that are perforated in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
with a prearranged design. The warp threads, instead
of being passed through the loops of two heddles,
are passed through what might be termed
individual heddles, one for each thread, or for a
small group of threads. These consist of cords in
each of which is an eyelet through which the warp
thread passes. The cord is weighted at its lower
end and its upper end is fastened to a hook in a
box at the top of the machine. The hooks engage
transverse bars known as “griffes” or “knives,”
and when the griffes are raised, the hooks engaging
them are also raised. In this way the warp threads
that pass through the eyelets that are connected
to the hooks are raised. But running horizontally
across the hooks there are “needles” or rods with
eyelets or bends in them through which the hooks
pass. These needles may be moved lengthwise to
make the hoops engage or disengage the knives.
The mechanism is illustrated in Figure 70, where
the knives are shown in section at <i>A</i>, the hooks at <i>B</i>
and the needles at <i>C</i>. For the sake of simplicity
only eight hooks and needles are shown; in actual
practice there are hundreds in a single machine.
At the right-hand end of each needle there is a
spring which pushes the needle toward the left,
thereby bringing the hook through which it passes
into position to be lifted by its griffe. At the left-hand
side of the machine there is a card (<i>D</i>) which
presses back the needles and thereby bends the
hooks out of position to engage the griffes. However,
there are perforations in the card through
which certain of the needles can pass, letting the
hooks they control engage the needles. The cards
thus select the particular weft threads that are to
be raised. In our illustration most of the needles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
have entered holes in the card, but the second,
fourth and sixth from the top have been pushed back
by the blank wall of the card and their hooks have
been bent back clear of the griffes. Only four
cards are shown in the drawing arranged in a four-sided
box or “cylinder,” and the cards are successively
presented to the needles. For more elaborate
designs a large number of cards are used, arranged
in a slatted belt, and these come successively into
position. As many as thirty thousand cards have
been employed to carry out a single pattern.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE KNITTING MACHINE</h3>

<p>We are wont to call Necessity the Mother of Invention;
in many cases Laziness has given rise to
valuable inventions, but according to legend, Cupid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
played the leading rôle in the development of the
knitting machine. It is said that in 1589 William
Lee of England fell in love, but the girl who was
the object of his devotion was always so busy with
her knitting that she could not give him the attention
he sought or thought he deserved. However,
Lee was not to be thwarted in this fashion,
so he built a machine to do the knitting in order
that the girl could devote herself more completely
to him.</p>

<p>There is another less pleasant version of the
story to the effect that Lee became so attached to
his knitting machine that he neglected the girl.
However, in either case, love was somehow mixed up
in the invention of the knitting machine.</p>

<p>We are not going to attempt to delve into the complicated
mechanism of a modern knitting machine,
but will merely call attention to the fact that
modern machines perform automatically practically
all the movements of the human hand in
hand knitting.</p>

<p>The tendency of modern machinery has been to
relieve the housewife of the tedious work she
formerly performed and to take such work away
from the home to the factory. There is one important
machine, however, which has been introduced
into the home, apparently to stay; for in the majority
of houses it is still considered indispensable. It
is a fact that the introduction of labor-saving machinery
into the household has, until recently, met
with stern opposition on the part of the housewife.
It is all the more remarkable, therefore,
that in the middle of the nineteenth century
the sewing machine began successfully to invade
the home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOWE’S INVENTION OF THE SEWING MACHINE</h3>

<p>It was in 1844 that Elias Howe hit upon the brilliant
idea of putting an eye at the point of a needle.
This enabled him to produce a successful sewing
machine, because it was unnecessary for him to
pass the needle completely through the cloth in
order to pull the thread through it. When the
needle point penetrated the cloth a shuttle passed
through the loop of thread that was carried
through with the point. This shuttle carried a
second thread which interlocked with the thread
of the needle forming what is known as a “lock
stitch.” In Howe’s machine the cloth was held
vertically and the needle which was curved was carried
by a lever. The needle was driven through
the cloth with a swinging motion, somewhat like
that of a pick-ax. The shuttle was driven back and
forth by a pair of strikers after the manner of
the flying shuttle of a loom. George Fisher, a
friend of Howe, furnished $500 with which the
first successful machine was built in 1845, and
with this machine Howe sewed two suits of clothes,
one for Mr. Fisher and the other for himself. A
public exhibition was held at which the machine,
crude as it was, beat five of the best hand-sewers
that could be found. In 1863 Howe was reaping a
fortune in royalties from his machine which were
estimated at $4,000 per day.</p>

<p>The next notable improvement in sewing machinery
was that of the rotary bobbin, invented by
A. B. Wilson, which was patented in 1852. This
did away with the flying shuttle and simplified the
machine considerably. It made the sewing machine
comparatively quiet, thus adapting it for domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
use. In Wilson’s machine, a rotating hook passed
through the loop of thread and carried it around
the bobbin on which the lower thread was wound.
Wilson also invented the four-motion feed for feeding
the cloth under the needle. Sewing machines
up to that time had been operated by hand, but
Isaac Merritt Singer introduced a foot-power machine
and by progressive business methods built up
a thriving industry and did much to establish the
sewing machine, not only at home, but abroad
as well.</p>

<h3>THE SINGLE-THREAD SEWING MACHINE</h3>

<p>The single-thread machine was invented by a
Virginia farmer who had never seen a sewing machine.
James E. A. Gibbs had seen a picture of a
sewing machine and, unaware of the fact that there
was a shuttle carrying a second thread on the rear,
or under side of the cloth, fell to puzzling over the
problem of what happened to the thread carried by
the needle through the cloth. Somehow, it seemed
to him, the loop of thread must be held until the
next stitch carried another loop of thread through
it, thus forming a chain stitch. This led him to
invent an ingenious revolving hook. With infinite
patience he whittled out a model of his invention,
and it is this hook that is the outstanding feature
of the Wilcox and Gibbs machine.</p>

<h3>MACHINE-MADE EMBROIDERIES</h3>

<p>A notable modern development of the sewing
machine is its adaptation to the making of embroideries
and even laces. In the common domestic
sewing machine the cloth is fed step by step under
the needle, and the length of the step regulates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
size or length of the stitches. The feed may be set
for short or long stitches. It is evident that if a
greater range of length of stitch were provided,
and if, while the machine was operating, the stitch
could be varied at will, not only in length but in the
direction as well, it would be possible to work
out elaborate patterns of embroidery. This is what
is done on the power-driven embroidery machines.
Like the original Howe machine, the cloth is held
vertically and a series of needles are used which
pass horizontally through the cloth. As the needle
retreats, the thread it carries forms a loop on the
rear or “wrong” side of the cloth, and through this
a shuttle is driven which carries a thread wound
upon a bobbin. Between stitches the cloth is moved
this way and that, in accordance with a prearranged
pattern, and thus the design is embroidered.
A single machine may have several hundred needles
and, as they all work in unison, each needle
repeats the design. The arrangement is such that
one needle starts where the next one leaves off, so
that the embroidery is continuous. The shuttles
which operate on the wrong side of the cloth are
small, boat-shaped parts which the Swiss have
named “schiffli” or “little ships,” and this name has
come to be applied to the whole machine.</p>

<p>The guiding of the cloth to produce the required
design is accomplished either by hand or automatically.
In the hand-guided schiffli machine a
skilled “stitcher” seated at one side of the machine
operates a pantagraph, tracing an enlarged design
mounted on a board before him. As he moves the
lever vertically and horizontally the frame carrying
the cloth is correspondingly moved before the
needles. An expert stitcher can put a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of individuality into the work, which is impossible
in the strictly automatic machine; accordingly the
pantagraph is used for the finer grades of embroideries.
In the automatic machines a perforated
roll like that of a piano player is used. The
perforations control the movements of the frame
that carries the fabric.</p>

<h3>FINE NEEDLEWORK BY MACHINE</h3>

<p>These machines are of Swiss and German design,
but American inventors have recently developed a
machine for producing fine needlework which imitates
very closely the work of the hand. In this
machine the needle passes completely through the
fabric as in ordinary hand sewing, but it does not
have to be turned around for the return stitch because
it is pointed at each end and has the eye in
the middle. The needles are held by spring clips
in a swinging frame. When the frame swings toward
the cloth the needles are pushed through the
fabric and their points are caught by spring clips in
a frame on the opposite side. The latter frame
draws the needles completely through and a set
of hooks catch the thread and pull the stitch taut.
The advantage of this type of machine is that it
produces the same design on each side of the cloth;
in other words, there is no “wrong” side to the
embroidery. The design is controlled by a
“stitcher” operating a pantagraphic system of
levers and by skillful manipulation he can completely
overcome the flat machinelike appearance
of the automatic schiffli machine.</p>

<p>Laces are very ingeniously produced on schiffli
machines by using the “burnt-out” system invented
forty years ago by a German, named Beckel. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
consists in the use of thread of a different material
from that of the fabric, and after the embroidery
is completed the fabric is removed either chemically
or by the application of heat, leaving only the
stitching, which forms a delicate lace. For instance,
cotton thread may be embroidered on a
groundwork of wool, or silk thread is used on a
fabric of cotton. Laces made in this way are
known as Plauen laces, taking their name from the
city where Beckel invented the process, and they
form a large part of the machine-made laces that
are now so widely used.</p>

<p class="pch">THE MAKING OF PAPER</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE MAKING of paper is closely related to that of
textiles. In each case the same basic materials are
used. A mass of interlacing fibers is formed into
a continuous sheet, but the method of interlacing the
fibers and holding them together is entirely different.
Paper resembles felt more closely than any
other form of fabric. The fibers are not woven but
are matted together and compressed. In the case of
felt the fibers of wool or hair are held together
mainly by the microscopic barbs that they possess
while paper fibers are held together by means of
sizing.</p>

<p>Although paper gets its name from papyrus the
latter was not paper, for it was a felt of pith rather
than fiber. The ancients produced a very fair writing
material from the rushlike plants that grew in
the swamps along the Nile. The stem of the papyrus
was stripped of its bark and the pith was cut
into thin ribbons which were laid side by side to
form a sheet. Over these and at right angles to them
was laid another layer of pith ribbons. The material
was then soaked in water, pressed into a continuous
sheet and dried. These sheets were then pasted
together and rolled up into scrolls. Unquestionably
they played a most important part in the civilization
of ancient Egypt, providing, as they did, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ready means of recording knowledge and disseminating
it among the people.</p>

<h3>CHINESE INVENTION OF PAPER</h3>

<p>Like so many inventions that are of vital importance
to modern civilization, paper is a Chinese
invention. The Chinese made paper from the fibers
of trees, a material to which we have reverted in
recent years. The invention dates from about 150
<span class="smcap">A. D.</span>, when some one devised a process of reducing
the bark of the mulberry tree to a pulp, beating it
and boiling it in lye and then matting the fibers on a
screen and pressing them into a finished sheet. The
process was introduced into Europe by the crusaders
in the 12th Century. In 1150 a paper-making plant
was established in Italy and soon the new writing
material was being made in increasing quantities
and became a common article throughout Europe.
It was not until the end of the 18th Century that
machinery for making paper came into use.</p>

<p>In the old hand process which is still used to a
very limited extent for special papers, the pulp,
after being reduced to a thin milky fluid, was dipped
out of a vat with a rectangular sieve which had a
wire screen bottom of fine mesh. The water drained
off, leaving the fibers upon the screen. As the pulp
was draining the sieve was shaken about to distribute
the fibers evenly and interlace them as much
as possible. The depth of the sieve determined the
amount of pulp that was dipped out and hence the
thickness of the paper. The soft, matted mass of
fibers was turned out upon a felt mat and left to
dry. Soon other fibers came to be used and the
finest grades of paper were made from linen and
cotton rags. The rags were carefully sorted out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
washed after which they were stored in a damp place
to rot for a number of weeks. Then they were cut
and shredded and boiled until they were converted
into a pulp. The complete process of making fine
paper by hand took from two to three months. Paper
was made in small sheets limited by the size of sieve
that could readily be operated by hand.</p>

<p>The first man to make a continuous web of paper
was Nicholas Louis Robert, a Frenchman who received
a reward of 8,000 francs from his government
for his invention. Robert’s patent rights were
acquired by the Fourdrinier Brothers (Henry and
Sealy), of England. They developed and perfected
the machine and to them is ascribed the honor of
founding the modern paper industry.</p>

<h3>USES OF PAPER</h3>

<p>Paper is more commonly and extensively used to-day
than any other product of manufacture and is
employed for an astonishing variety of purposes,
ranging from milk bottles to suits of clothing. One
very novel use we might mention, in passing, is to
be found on the sugar plantations of Hawaii. After
the cane is planted the fields are covered with a
thick paper made, by the way, from sugar-cane fiber.
This covering prevents the weeds from growing, but
the sharp spikes of the sugar sprouts pierce the
paper and grow through it. By the time the paper
has disintegrated and the weeds have a chance to
grow, the cane has such a start on them that they are
kept shaded and cannot compete with or choke out
the cane.</p>

<h3>TURNING FORESTS INTO PULP</h3>

<p>Before we proceed to describe the modern Fourdrinier
machine, we must look into present day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
methods of preparing pulp. The finest papers are
still made from linen and cotton rags. Esparto
grass is largely used in Europe. This comes from
Spain and North Africa. But by far the greater
part of the paper produced to-day is made from the
fiber of trees. Particularly is this true of our own
country, which consumes half of the world’s output
of paper.</p>

<p>It used to be that only the poorest grades of paper
were made from wood pulp; now however not only
newspapers but nearly all books and magazines are
printed on a forest product. Formerly only spruce
wood was considered suitable for paper manufacture,
but the rapid depletion of this raw material
led to the employment of many other species of
trees and our Government scientists are constantly
searching for and experimenting with new woods
for this purpose.</p>

<p>Because of the insatiable appetites of our large
newspaper printing presses and because a newspaper
is not intended to be an imperishable document
but a fleeting record of passing events, quality
is of little importance in the preparation of pulp for
newsprint and everything must be sacrificed for
speed. The pulp is made of “ground” wood as distinguished
from the chemically prepared wood pulp
known as “sulphite.” The wood is first stripped of
its bark and then cut into pieces running from two
to four feet in length, depending upon the size of
the magazine of the grinder. The wood is pressed
against a revolving grindstone by hydraulic pressure
and at such an angle that the fibers torn off will
be as long as possible. The fibers are borne off by
a stream of water which carries them through a set
of screens. These remove any unground slivers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and eventually the pulp is drained of water and
pressed into laps, or, if it is to be used immediately,
it goes directly to the beating engine. Here it is
mixed with a certain amount of “sulphite pulp,”
usually from 20 to 25 per cent. To correct the yellowish
color of the pulp, a small amount of blue and
red coloring is added. To give body to the paper
from 5 to 15 per cent of clay is mixed into the pulp
and, to bind the fibers together and give the paper
a finish that will be at least partly nonabsorbent,
a quantity of rosin and soda ash is added with
enough alum to precipitate the rosin upon the
fibers. The beater thoroughly mixes the mass of
material and converts it into a fluid of the consistency
of thin milk, which then passes on to the Fourdrinier
machine.</p>

<h3>GETTING DOWN TO THE “BONES” OF THE WOOD</h3>

<p>Paper made from ground wood pulp soon discolors
and becomes brittle owing to the presence
of the lignin and resin of the tree. The superiority
of sulphite pulp is due to the fact that chemical
processes are used to remove these disturbing ingredients,
leaving only the “bones” of the tree, that
is, the pure cellulose fiber. Spruce wood is usually
used and after being freed of its bark and thoroughly
cleaned, all knots are cut out and it is sawed
into short lengths which are then split and cut up
into little chips from ¼ to ½ inch long. These
chips are boiled under pressure in a solution of sulphur
dioxide and slaked lime. The “digesters” in
which the chips are boiled are large steel cylinders
lined with brick set in cement and coated with litharge
and glycerin, so as to prevent the sulphite
liquor from coming into contact with the metal. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
steam pressure of seventy to eighty pounds is maintained
for eight to ten hours and then the digesters
are discharged into vats. The sulphite liquor in
which the resinous matter is dissolved is drained
away and the pulp is washed.</p>

<p>Soft woods, such as poplar, basswood, etc., are
boiled in caustic soda, producing what is known as
“soda pulp.” “Sulphate pulp” is made by boiling
in a solution of sodium sulphate, to which a certain
amount of sodium carbonate and caustic soda are
added. This process is used for producing pulp
for so-called “Kraft” paper and brown wrapping
paper.</p>

<p>Formerly pulp was always made in the paper
mill and hence the mills had to be located near the
source of wood supply, but to-day the making of
pulp is carried on as an independent industry in
remote forest regions where water power is plentiful.
The pulp is pressed into laps and compressed
into bales weighing about 400 pounds. These are
sent over long distances by rail or steamship to
paper mills located in or near the big cities, so that
the paper may be made near the points of consumption.</p>

<p>Baled paper pulp has to be reconverted into a
smooth milklike fluid. A shredding machine is
used for this purpose, which tears the pulp apart
and mixes it with water. Then it goes to the beater
where it receives its quota of sulphite pulp, coloring
matter, clay, and sizing, as explained before.
After an hour of treatment in the beater, it passes
on to a tank in which it is further diluted with water
and is then put through a Jordan engine. This
consists of a conical cylinder in which is placed a
conical roll. Both cylinder and roll are formed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
knives that extend longitudinally, but the revolving
knives are set at a slight angle to the fixed knives,
somewhat after the fashion of a lawn mower. The
conical form permits of careful adjustment of the
roller in the cylinder. The pulp mixture enters at
the smaller end and discharges at the larger end.
This machine gives the pulp its final beating and
reduces it to a very smooth consistency.</p>

<h3>THE FOURDRINIER PAPER-MAKING MACHINE</h3>

<p>From the Jordan engine the pulp is passed on
into the Fourdrinier machine, which we are now
ready to investigate. The principal element of this
machine is a traveling belt of copper wire gauze
which takes the place of the screen or sieve used
in the hand process. To confine the pulp to the belt
there are two endless bands of rubber, known as
“deckles,” along each edge of the screen, which travel
with the screen. To insure proper interlacing of
the fibers, as in the hand process, the screen is
shaken laterally at the rate of about 300 vibrations
per minute.</p>

<p>The fluid pulp enters the machine through a flow
box, where a constant hydraulic head is maintained,
so as to preserve a uniform discharge to the wire
gauze. The milky stream issues through a narrow
opening in the flow box, known as a “slicer.” This
may be adjusted to alter the width and also the
thickness of the stream. No one would suspect
from the appearance of the milky fluid that it is
filled with fibers, but a microscopic examination of
a drop of the thin liquid shows that it is filled with
tiny particles floating in the water like logs in a
river. It is interesting to watch this stream, as it
passes out upon the screen, change magically before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
one’s eyes, from a milky stream into solid mass of
pulp.</p>

<p class="p2">In Figure 71, which is a diagrammatical view of
a portion of a Fourdrinier machine, the flow box is
shown at <i>A</i> and the copper gauze belt at <i>B</i>. This
belt is supported on a series of rollers, <i>C</i>. The
deckles which confine the pulp along the margins
of the screen are shown at <i>D</i>. These belts travel
with the wire gauze for a certain distance and then
pass back over the pulleys, <i>EE</i>, while the wire cloth
passes on and around the drums, <i>FF</i>. As soon as
the pulp flows out upon the wire gauze, the water
it contains begins to drain away through the gauze.
But it does not do this fast enough under the mere
pull of gravity and it must be helped by means of
suction. At <i>GG</i> there are boxes or troughs that
fit against the under side of the wire gauze. In
them a partial vacuum is maintained by means of
suction pumps and a large part of the water remaining
in the pulp is sucked out here. A dandy roll is
shown at <i>H</i>, which presses lightly upon the moist
pulp, squeezing out the moisture in it, and at
<i>I</i> there is a final suction box which further dries
the web of fibers. It is the dandy roll that puts a
patterned surface on the paper. If the face of the
dandy roll is of finely woven wire cloth with diagonal
mesh, a “wove” paper is produced, while if it is
of such surface as to impress parallel lines in the
half-formed paper, “laid” paper is produced. Water
marks are also produced by placing a suitable raised
or depressed pattern on the dandy roll, producing
a corresponding thickening or thinning of the pulp.
Even after passing the last suction box, the thin
web of paper is still very wet and so flimsy that it
cannot be handled. Right here comes the most
delicate part of the
whole process. The
web must be picked
off the wire cloth and
carried across a narrow
gap to a felt
belt which conducts it
through another set
of rollers, A felt-covered
roll, <i>J</i>,
known as a “couch”
roll, presses down
upon the web and
the latter clings to
the felt in place of
the wire cloth which
passes down around
the roller <i>F</i>. In
starting a web of
paper very skillful
manipulation is required
to transfer
the web from the
couch roll to the felt
belt, but after it has
once bridged the gap
it has enough tensional
strength to
pull itself across the
gap. The felt belt
carries the web
through a pair of
heavy rollers which
press out more of
the water. Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the paper passes through the rolls with the felt belt
it receives an impression from the felt on the under
side. This is now corrected by running the paper
through a second pair of rolls in the reverse direction,
and on a second felt belt, so that both sides of
the paper receive the same impression. From here
on the paper passes through a long series of steam-heated
drying rolls and emerges eventually as a
perfectly dry sheet.</p>

<p>Our largest Fourdrinier machines make a web
200 inches wide and they can be run at a rate of 800
feet per minute, or more than nine miles per hour.
The paper is made in lengths eight miles long, which
are wound up into rolls to be fed into the huge printing
presses of our metropolitan newspaper plants.</p>

<p>The difference between the making of news print
and finer papers lies chiefly in the quality of pulp
used and the quantity of clay and sizing added.
After the finer grades have issued from the drying
rolls, they are put through calenders to give them a
glazed surface. This consists virtually in ironing
the paper between smooth rolls of iron on one side
and compressed paper or cotton on the other. Just
as in ironing clothes, the paper must be moistened
before being ironed and steam is used to supply the
necessary moisture. In some cases a high glaze is
given to one side only of the paper by means of friction.
The paper passes between two rollers of different
size. The smaller one travels faster than
the larger one and consequently it slips on the
paper, giving it a very smooth surface.</p>

<h3>THE CYLINDER MACHINE FOR MAKING PAPER</h3>

<p>There is another type of paper-making machine
which is used for coarse papers, pasteboard, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
This is known as a cylinder machine. The wire
gauze is formed into a cylinder which revolves in
the liquid pulp. A slight suction is maintained
in the cylinder which causes the water to flow in
through the gauze; leaving the fiber drained on the
surface. The cylinder revolves, carrying the drained
pulp on its surface until it encounters a felt roll
that picks off the web and carries it to the pressing
and drying rolls. One disadvantage of this type
of machine is that the cylinder in dragging the
drained pulp through the water causes the fibers to
be combed in a direction parallel to the run of the
paper web, so that the paper, while strong in the
direction of its length, is comparatively weak in the
transverse direction. This is corrected to a certain
degree by the use of “riffles” or devices that produce
eddies which disturb the even flow of the pulp.</p>

<p>In the making of pasteboard, a number of cylinders
contribute their webs to form a single sheet of
several plies.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pch">TYPESETTING AND PRINTING MACHINERY</p>

<p class="drop-cap03">“WHO WON the war?” The question immediately
brings forth numerous contenders who
claim the honor, respectively, for the aviator, the
chemist, the engineer, the mechanic, the farmer,
the shipbuilder, etc. As a matter of fact, all these
and many others as well were invaluable contributors
to the final success, and “there is glory
enough for all.”</p>

<p>The question, “What branch of technology or
what branch of machinery has done most for civilization?”
finds a similar division of opinion, with
partisans in favor of the steam engine, machine
tools, electrical machinery, iron manufacture, paper
making, printing, etc. Again, it is clearly evident
that all have been most valuable contributors and
none may carry off all the honors. However, partisans
of the printing press are entitled to place
that machine among the foremost because it has
certainly been most useful in preserving and disseminating
all classes of knowledge and in promoting
the progress of civilization.</p>

<h3>EARLY CHINESE PRINTING</h3>

<p>It is hardly necessary for us to refer to Johann
Gutenberg’s invention in 1436 of separate type for
each letter. Many centuries before that the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
had made wood engravings of complete pages
and printed them on paper. Their method was to
prepare an ink copy on a sheet of paper and then
transfer the copy by pressing the paper on the
wood before the ink was dry, after which they
carved away all the surface except those parts
which were inked. This gave them a reverse plate
from which any number of copies could be printed.
The invention of individual type which could be
used over and over again for setting new copy was
a marked improvement over the Chinese system.</p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF PRINTING PRESSES</h3>

<p>The primitive screw press saw little improvement
except in minor details down to the end of the
eighteenth century. Then steam began to take the
place of hand power and the idea was conceived of
using a rotary cylinder in place of a flat press.
The types were tapered so that they could be fitted
about a cylinder. The paper was fed between the
type cylinder and a soft impression cylinder faced
with leather. The ink was applied to the type by
means of a roller which was fed by an inking
apparatus.</p>

<p>In 1814 two rotary presses were installed in the
offices of the London “Times,” making it possible to
turn out that newspaper at the marvelous rate of
11,000 impressions per hour. In this country,
Richard Marsh Hoe invented a machine in which
four, six, eight, or ten impression cylinders operated
on a single form of type, thereby increasing
the output of the press correspondingly. The first
machine, a four-impression cylinder press, was
used by the Philadelphia “Ledger” in 1846, and it
printed 8,000 papers per hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Next came the “perfecting” press that printed
on both sides of the paper, and then came the continuous
web press, in which the paper was fed from
a roll as a continuous sheet and, after receiving
the type impression, was cut, folded, and delivered
as a complete newspaper.</p>

<h3>THE STEREOTYPE PLATE</h3>

<p>Meanwhile stereotyping was introduced into newspaper
printing. In stereotyping an impression in
plastic material is made of the type face and then
a casting is made from this impression which, of
course, exactly duplicates the type face. The type
is thus relieved from wear in the press and it is
immediately released for use in setting up other
copy while the printing is done from the stereotype
plate. While the use of stereotyping in book printing
dates back to the eighteenth century, it was not
thought practicable for newspaper printing because
of the length of time taken in making the plate,
but in 1861 papier-maché was introduced as a
matrix material and a system of rapidly drying the
mold was developed so that a plate could be cast
in a comparatively short time; furthermore, impressions
could be made from a flat face of type
and then the mold could be bent so as to make
curved stereotype plates for use on the cylinder
presses. In newspaper work it takes but five
minutes to make a stereotype plate. Stereotype
metal does not stand the wear of printing very long
and the plates must be renewed from time to time.
This fits in well with newspaper requirements because
clean cut work is not called for, and as the
news keeps coming in new editions must constantly
be printed, which means that new plates must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
made from time to time. For the finer printing of
magazines and books, copper-faced electrotype
plates are used in place of the soft stereotype plates
of newspaper printing.</p>

<h3>MODERN NEWSPAPER PRESSES</h3>

<p>A modern large newspaper press is a bewildering
sight to behold; there is such a vast number of
rolls and cylinders, and the web of paper moves so
rapidly. But, after all, the machine is multiplex
rather than complex. It consists of a large number
of printing cylinders, all operating in a single
frame. Take, for instance, a double-octuple, color-combination
press. It consists really of two separate
presses, each operating on four webs of paper
that feed from opposite ends toward the middle.
There are two type cylinders for each web, one for
each side of the paper. Each cylinder is long
enough to take four stereotype plates side by side,
and since each plate extends but half way around
the cylinder we have eight pages printed on each
side of the web. This makes sixteen pages per web
or sixty-four for each half of the machine, giving
a total of 128 page impressions at each turn of the
cylinders. It is seldom that a 64-page paper is required,
hence the webs are slit in two by a revolving
knife blade and each section of the press has
two folding mechanisms so that two sets of 16-page
papers are printed, folded, and delivered by each
section. Arrangements are provided whereby the
product may consist of 32-page papers. The papers
are delivered by a traveling conveyor and every
fiftieth paper is pushed out ahead of the others so
as to provide a simple method of keeping count of
the product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<h3>PRINTING 240,000 PAGES PER HOUR</h3>

<p>The cylinders turn at the rate of 300 revolutions
per minute which means that the paper runs
through the machine at nearly 14 miles per hour.
Summing up all the webs we have a total consumption
of 108 miles of paper per hour. The paper
is 6 feet wide and the weight of paper in an hour’s
run is about 18 tons and the hourly production is
150,000 sixteen-page papers. When color is used,
the press will deliver 50,000 24-page papers
per hour with the two outside pages printed in
three colors and black. The course of the color
printed web must necessarily be different from
that of the plain black printed web. It must pass
through a number of printings; and to prevent the
moist ink from transferring to the impression rolls
and from them back to a succeeding page, thus soiling
or blurring the impression, an extra roll of thin
paper is passed between the printed web and the
impression cylinders. This acts in a measure as a
blotter. The offset paper is taken up on a roll and
used over and over again. It is used not only for
color work, but also when fine half tone engravings
are to be printed so that a cleaner impression may
be obtained.</p>

<p>The inking system of printing press is very
elaborate. It is highly essential that the ink be
spread upon the type surface in just sufficient
quantity to be picked up by the paper and that the
ink be uniformly distributed over the whole surface.
There is an ink reservoir and a set of inking
rollers for each cylinder. The reservoir consists of
a trough running the whole length of the cylinder.
At each turn a revolving roller dips into the ink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and transfers a thin film of ink to a series of small
rollers. These are grouped about a large roller to
which they deliver the ink. The small rollers have
an axial reciprocating motion whereby the ink
is uniformly spread over the large roller. The
latter transfers its thin coating of ink to a pair of
rollers known as “form rollers” and these in turn
deliver the ink to the printing cylinder.</p>

<h3>A SEA CAPTAIN’S CONTRIBUTION</h3>

<p>The folding mechanism of a printing press is
interesting. The paper is first fed over a wedge-shaped
form which folds the paper lengthwise and
then it is given a cross-wise fold. Curiously enough
the folding mechanism for printing presses was
first invented by a Yankee sea captain, named
Cromwell, who could not read a drawing but developed
his invention by whittling out wooden
models. He also contributed other valuable improvements
for the printing press worked out in
the same primitive way.</p>

<p>The rotary press was evolved especially for the
printing of daily papers and for a long time magazines
continued to be printed on flat-bed presses.
But as the circulation of magazines grew into the
hundreds of thousands it became necessary to
build high speed presses to turn out these large
editions. Accordingly rotary machines were constructed
similar in design to newspaper presses,
but with refinements to enable them to produce the
better class of work required of magazine printing.
Although there are many magazines still printed
on flat bed presses, particularly those which publish
small editions of less than a hundred thousand,
all the big national weekly journals and monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
magazines are printed on rotary presses and some
of them even use web presses.</p>

<h3>GATHERING AND BINDING MAGAZINES</h3>

<p>When a newspaper leaves the press it is folded,
cut, and ready for the news stand. Not so with the
book and magazine press. There are too many
pages to be handled by a single press, and, furthermore,
the pages must be bound together. Some
large magazines contain regularly more than 500
pages and occasionally they will run over a thousand
pages. Obviously no single press could handle
so many pages and it takes the product of many
presses to make up a single copy. Each press prints
what is known as a form or signature and these
signatures from the different presses are then gathered,
wire-stitched, and bound into individual
copies. There are machines which will do this work
of gathering and binding at the rate of sixty 1,000-page
magazines or catalogues every minute. The
machines are adjustable for pages of different
dimensions. The forms may consist of four, eight, sixteen,
or thirty-two pages. A separate compartment
is provided for each signature. A large machine
will handle thirty-six 32-page signatures. The compartments
are kept supplied by an operator, there
being usually six compartments for each operator
to attend to. The bottom signature in each compartment
is brought into position by a suction device
which seizes the signature and draws it out,
depositing it in a steel trough. Here a belt conveyor
moves the signature along at the right speed
to carry it before the next compartment just as a
signature is being withdrawn therefrom. Thus the
magazine or book is progressively built up and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
signatures reach the end of their course properly
assembled. A very delicate adjustment is provided
to insure the proper adjustment of signatures. The
grippers are adjusted to receive signatures of a certain
thickness. If the operator should make a mistake
and put a signature of a wrong size in the
compartment the whole machine would come to a
standstill. The adjustment is so delicate that even
a variation of a single thickness of paper is enough
to operate the stop mechanism. Each assembly of
signatures as it reaches the end of the trough is
squared up and then bound with wire stitching.
From this point it moves on to receive its cover.
A thin coating of hot glue is applied to the rear
edge of the signatures. The cover is automatically
applied and firmly pressed into place. The finished
book is then carried on out of the machine and deposited
neatly on a pile of previously bound books.
To operate such a machine there are required one
chief operator and an assistant and six girls to feed
the signatures to the compartments.</p>

<h3>SETTING TYPE BY MACHINE</h3>

<p>The publication of a modern daily newspaper
with its many special editions would be well nigh
impossible if we still had to depend upon hand
setting of type. Tens of thousands of type characters
are required to make up a single newspaper
page, and although skilled hand compositors work
with extreme rapidity it would take a large corps
of men to set type for even a small newspaper in
the short time available. Speed is of prime importance
in newspaper work and the task of handling
thousands of little pieces of type metal and arranging
them correctly into words and sentences was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
long recognized as a serious handicap, but the problem
of doing this work by machine was by no
means simple one and baffled inventors for years.
One of the principal difficulties lay in the size and
shape of the type and another was that of justifying
the lines, that is, providing just the right width
of spaces between words to fill out the lines completely
so that they would all be of equal length,
giving a straight instead of a ragged margin to the
column. After that came the problem of redistributing
the type.</p>

<p>The first really successful composing machine
was the invention of Ottmar Mergenthaler in 1888.
Mergenthaler overcame the difficulties that had
balked other inventors by attacking the problem
from a radically new angle. Instead of setting precast
type, his machine cast its own type from a
set of matrices. By operating a keyboard, the
matrices were assembled in a line which was justified
automatically after the line was composed and
then the whole line of type was cast in a single slug.
Hence his machine earned the name “linotype.”
Then the matrices were returned automatically distributed
to the proper channels of the matrix magazine
ready to be used over again for succeeding slugs.</p>

<h3>THE LINOTYPE MATRIX AND SPACE BAR</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-331.jpg" width="250" height="313"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc250">FIG. 72&mdash;A LINOTYPE MATRIX</p>
</div></div>

<p>A picture of a linotype matrix is shown in Figure
72. It is a plate of brass formed with ears <i>A</i> at the
four corners. The type mold is shown at <i>B</i> and of
course the thickness of the matrix varies with the
width of the type letter it is designed to cast. In
the top of the matrix there is a V-shaped slot <i>C</i>
formed with teeth which are designed to engage
grooves in a V-shaped bar over the matrix magazine.
The teeth on the matrices are variously cut
away and serve as keys to the different channels of
the magazine. There is a different combination of
teeth for each letter of the alphabet and all
matrices of the same letter have the same combination
of teeth. The teeth on the distributing bar are
also cut away according to various combinations.
After the line has been cast the matrices are all
raised by their ears and fed one by one upon the
distributing bar. Each matrix moves along until it
arrives over the channel it is designed to enter
when it comes to a gap in the teeth of the bar that
are supporting it and drops into the magazine. Although
there are but seven teeth on each side of the
V-shaped bar, there are more than enough combinations
possible to provide a characteristic one for
every key of the keyboard. A matrix always has
at least one pair of teeth in engagement with the
bar until it reaches the gap that lets it fall into
its own special channel of the magazine. The number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of matrices of each character varies with the
normal frequency of use of that letter. For instance,
the letter <i>e</i> is very commonly used, and
there must be many more <i>e</i> matrices than <i>z</i>
matrices, but in any case the number need not be
very large because the process of casting a line and
redistributing the type does not take very long and
the matrices are soon back in the magazine ready
to be used over again. The casting and distributing
operations are entirely automatic and while they
are in process the compositor is setting a new line.</p>

<p>The method of spacing which was a later development
of the linotype is also very ingenious.
The compositor does not have to bother with the
width of spaces required to fill out a line. He merely
touches the space key at the end of each word and
and a space bar drops into place. Each space bar
is formed of a pair of wedges and after the line
has been assembled the space bars are automatically
expanded to fill out the line completely by
mechanism which holds down one wedge member
(A, Figure 73) and slides up the other (B).</p>

<h3>INDIVIDUAL TYPE CASTING AND COMPOSING</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-333.jpg" width="200" height="398"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc250">FIG. 73.&mdash;A LINOTYPE SPACE BAR</p>
</div></div>

<p>The difficulties of casting the linotype slug
proved a serious handicap in the earlier days of
the linotype. The product of the machine could not
compare in quality with precast hand-set individual
type, although it served very well for newspapers;
but the machine is now so far perfected that it
is widely used for magazine and book composition.
However before this stage of perfection was
reached the demand for a machine that could do
a higher grade of work led to the invention of
another machine known as the “monotype.” The
monotype consists actually of two machines, one
of which is operated by a compositor and the other
operated entirely automatically by the product of
the first machine. The compositor operates a keyboard
and thereby cuts perforations in a long strip
of paper. These perforations are arranged in characteristic
groups one for each key. The perforated
paper is then run through the second machine and
in accordance with the various perforations the
separate types are cast and assembled into justified
lines. Air flowing through the perforations operates
a pneumatic mechanism which brings the proper
molds into position and casts the separate types.
The method of justifying the lines is very interesting.
As in the linotype the operator merely touches
a space key at the end of each word, but at the end
of the line the mechanism automatically estimates
the spaces to be filled and divides this by the number
of spaces so that a characteristic group of perforations
is punched when the compositor shifts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the next line. In the casting machine the paper
ribbon runs through backward and the space group
of perforations is encountered before the line is
cast. This automatically adjusts the mechanism
to cast spaces of the requisite size to fill out the
line exactly.</p>

<h3>WRITING BY MACHINE</h3>

<p>In one sense we have taken up the various machines
employed in printing in reverse order. Of
course the first machine used is the typewriter, after
which comes the composing machine, and finally
the press.</p>

<p>It was in 1866 that two inventors, C. Latham
Sholes and Samuel W. Soule, undertook to make
a machine for printing numbers in serial order
upon the pages of a blankbook. Carlos Glidden,
another inventor, who was engaged in developing
a spading machine designed to take the place of a
plow, saw their work and suggested that they make
their machine write letters and words as well as
numbers. The three combined and proceeded to
evolve the new machine. By the end of the summer
of 1867 they had produced a typewriting machine
that could be operated fairly rapidly and that produced
fair work. It was one of the letters written
by this machine that brought James Densmore into
the enterprise. He furnished the money needed to
improve the crude typewriter and make it a commercial
machine. Many models were built but nothing
was produced that seemed good enough for
commercial production. This development work
was too slow and discouraging for Soule and Glidden
and they dropped out, but Sholes inspired by
Densmore persevered until at last in 1873 he had
produced a machine which he could offer for manufacture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
The typewriter was then taken to the
Remington factory at Ilion, N. Y., and the next
year it was placed on the market and began its
public career.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the early development of the
typewriter. It has become so widely used and is
so indispensable a part of the business office that
it arouses the utmost astonishment to learn that
there still are a few old-fashioned houses so conservative
and so far behind that they continue to
write their business letters with the pen. So
common a machine, it is hardly necessary for
us to describe in detail except to mention two
steps in the development of the machine, namely
the arrangement of the type bars whereby the
typewriting is visible to the typist, and secondly
the effort to overcome noise by limiting the stroke
of the type bar and making it impinge upon the
paper with a pressure stroke rather than a hammer
blow.</p>

<p>A recent development is the “stenotype,” a small
machine which prints shorthand characters, thus
expediting the taking of rapid dictation.</p>

<p class="pch">CAST IRON, WROUGHT IRON, AND STEEL</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IT USED to be that wars were fought for gold, but
nowadays the possession of rich iron mines is
enough to arouse the cupidity of neighboring
nations less favored by nature. In fact, even though
an ounce of gold is worth twice as much as a ton
of iron, the value of the iron we dig out of the
earth each year is far greater than that of gold.
When that rough ore is converted into iron and
steel and then into thousands of useful articles, its
value mounts so high that it cannot be estimated.
The qualities of iron and its alloys are so
excellent and so varied under different treatment
that this metal may truly be said to form the
foundation of all our mechanical progress. On the
one hand it spans our wide rivers, carries the burden
of heavy freight trains, or, in the form of
armor plate, resists the terrific impact of high-powered
shells; on the other hand the same metal, spun
into a hair spring, governs the ship’s chronometer,
or, in the compass, points a trembling finger to
guide the navigator on his course.</p>

<h3>IRON IN ANCIENT DAYS</h3>

<p>The first use of iron in the service of man dates
far back into the ages. An iron tool was found in
the pyramid of Kephron which must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
used 3,500 years before Christ. However, because
of the difficulty of working it, iron was not extensively
employed except for swords and cutlery. The
conversion of iron into steel and the tempering of
steel blades grew to be an art which gave Damascus
and Toledo a world-wide reputation that dates back
over a thousand years.</p>

<p>The ancients used to smelt their iron ore in what
was known as a Catalan forge because of its extensive
use in Catalonia, Spain. Whether the forge
was invented there or not we cannot say. Similar
forges have been found in India and other widely
remote places. They comprised an inclined tray
leading to a pot which formed the furnace and
in which a charcoal fire was kindled. The ore and
charcoal were placed on the tray and from time to
time were raked down into the furnace and air was
forced into the bottom of the furnace by means of
bellows. In an improved form of the Catalan forge
air was furnished by means of an air compressor
operated by a stream of water. This has already
been referred to and illustrated on page 90. Limestone
served as a flux to melt the earthy matter.
The iron obtained from these primitive furnaces
was not heated sufficiently to flow as a stream, but
was merely reduced to a pasty mass which was then
hammered into shape by the blacksmith. Ten or
twelve pounds of metal per day was considered a
fair output for one of these forges.</p>

<h3>DISCOVERY OF COKE</h3>

<p>It was not until the middle of the 14th Century
that a blast furnace, crudely similar to those we
have to-day, was first built and with it a temperature
was obtained that was high enough to turn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
metal into a liquid which could be cast in molds.
Charcoal continued to be the fuel used until about
four centuries later, when Abraham Darby discovered
that by baking coal to remove its free gases,
he could produce a new fuel known as coke which
was a good substitute for charcoal. This gave a
wonderful impetus to the iron industry in England
where there were ample deposits of coal adjacent
to the iron mines. Shortly after that, Mr. Henry
Cort of Gasport, England, invented the processes of
puddling and rolling the product of the blast furnace,
thus converting the iron into a tough, malleable
metal.</p>

<h3>ALLOYS OF CARBON AND IRON</h3>

<p>We must pause here to learn the difference between
cast iron, wrought iron and steel. Iron, as
we know, has a high affinity for oxygen. When exposed
to air and moisture it oxidizes, rusts very
quickly. The iron we find in nature is largely
oxidized. In other words, it is rusty. It is also
found in combination with other elements as well.
The object of putting iron ore through a furnace
is to rid it of oxygen and this is most readily accomplished
by melting it in a carbon fire. The
highly heated carbon combines with the oxygen and
passes off as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
gas. But a certain amount of carbon unites with
the iron and it is this alloy of carbon and iron that
makes cast iron so stiff and brittle. The less carbon
present the softer is the metal and pure iron is
very ductile.</p>

<p>It was to rid cast iron of its carbon content
that Cort invented the puddling process. As the
metal came out of the blast furnace it ran into a
“reverberatory” furnace where, without coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
in contact with coke or other carbon fuel, it was
exposed to flames from an adjoining furnace which
burned out the carbon, and then the carbon-free
iron was cast into large pieces known as blooms
which were hammered to rid them of slag. The
final product was known as wrought iron. Wrought
iron then differs from cast iron in having no carbon.
Steel, on the other hand, stands half way
between wrought iron and cast iron in having a
small percentage of carbon. How steel is made
will be described later.</p>

<h3>MECHANICAL HANDLING OF ORE</h3>

<p>Of course machinery plays a large part in the
modern iron industry. It would be an endless task
even to load one of the big blast furnaces by hand
and then the enormous output of molten metal&mdash;40
tons for every pound produced by the old Catalan
furnaces&mdash;could not be handled without ponderous
machines whose huge arms and fingers are not
scorched and blistered by the intense heat. Along
the Great Lakes vast loading machines fill the holds
of ore vessels and at the plant there are enormous
unloading machines that travel on rails. These
have long bridgelike arms that reach out over the
ore boat and drop huge clam-shell buckets into their
holds. The buckets quickly unload the boats and
dump the ore on shore where other buckets pick
up the ore, carry it back and pile it up in big heaps
that look like mounds of reddish earth.</p>

<h3>THE MODERN BLAST FURNACE</h3>

<p>Blast furnaces are towering cylindrical structures
of steel lined with fire brick. They are
loaded from the top with alternate layers of coke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and ore. Limestone also is added to act as a flux
for the earthy matter, as explained above. Running
around the furnace near the base there is a large
pipe known as the “bustle” pipe. Through this air
is fed to a set of “tuyeres” which lead to the base
of the furnace and admit blasts of air requisite to
maintain combustion at an intense heat. The gases
of combustion are not allowed to escape freely into
the atmosphere. The top of the furnace through
which the ore and fuel is admitted is closed by an
air lock and the flaming hot gases are led into
“stoves” where they give up a large part of their
heat to preheat the air which is pumped to the blast
furnace. The gases being mainly composed of carbon
monoxide are further combustible and may be
used for heat, light, and power purposes. In fact,
they are commonly used to drive the air compressors
which feed the blast furnaces.</p>

<p>The blast furnace has two openings, one above the
other. Through the upper one slag is drawn off
while the molten iron which trickles down and
collects at the bottom of the furnace is tapped off
through a hole near the base of the furnace. The
fiery stream pours out into a lot of small trough-shaped
molds and is thus formed into “pigs.” These
pigs are all connected to the main body of the metal
stream and must be broken off. To save the time of
cooling and of breaking off the pigs a machine is
used which consists of a series of molds connected
to form an endless belt. The molten iron is poured
into these molds which in their course dip into a
trough of water. Here the iron is cooled and solidified.
The molds then run up an incline and finally
dump the pigs directly into railway cars which
haul them away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<h3>BURNING OUT THE CARBON</h3>

<p>The production of steel economically and on a
large scale dates back to the inventions of Henry
Bessemer. While searching for an improved method
of making big guns, Bessemer hit upon the idea
of forcing a blast of air through the molten iron
and thus burning away carbon, silicon, and manganese
in the cast iron. No fuel was supplied except
the carbon and silicon in the iron itself. In burning
out this carbon sufficient heat was generated to
keep the metal fluid.</p>

<p>When Bessemer made the announcement of his
new process before the British Association in
1856, his paper met with skepticism, but he was able
to demonstrate by actual experiment that cast iron
could be converted into malleable iron in this
way. However, when several firms operating under
licenses from the inventor endeavored to reproduce
his experiment on a commercial scale they were unsuccessful,
and after costly experiments the process
was given up as a failure. Bessemer, however,
persisted in his efforts and succeeded eventually in
producing malleable iron of a quality equal if not
superior to that on the market. But iron makers
after the failure of the first experiments would
have nothing to do with the new process until
Bessemer began to turn out quantities of iron at
$100 a ton below the prevailing market price. Then
iron makers woke up and Bessemer had no difficulty
in placing his process with numbers of firms
on a very profitable royalty basis.</p>

<p>This process pertained to the making of iron and
not steel. When Bessemer tried to produce steel he
was confronted with serious difficulties. The steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
he obtained was very brittle. He tried purer ores
with little better success. Then a solution of his
problem was offered by Robert F. Mushet, who discovered
a compound which would be added to the
molten metal to purify it. This compound which is
known as “spiegeleisen” is composed of iron, carbon,
and manganese. It removes the oxide of iron
and the sulphur and regulates the amount of carbon
in the steel.</p>

<p>A Bessemer converter furnishes by far the most
spectacular operation in steel manufacture. The
converter consists of a large bottle-shaped vessel
lined with refractory material. In the bottom of
the vessel there are openings through which the
air blast is admitted. The molten metal is poured
into the flask and then the air blast is turned on.
The metal begins to boil violently. A dazzlingly brilliant
blast of flame and sparks comes roaring out
of the mouth of the converter. Bubbles of metal are
thrown high into the air where they burst into
showers of sparks. The effect is similar to that of
a volcanic eruption. In from ten to twenty minutes
the eruption subsides and then a quantity of spiegeleisen
is added. The converter is mounted on
trunnions so that when the operation is completed
the vessel is tilted over and the charge of molten
metal now converted into steel is poured out.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450"> FIG. 74.&mdash;SECTIONAL VIEW OF A REGENERATIVE OPEN-HEARTH
FURNACE</p>
</div></div>

<p>While the Bessemer converter provides a very
economical and expeditious method of converting
cast iron into steel, it is difficult to regulate the
carbon content with great accuracy and hence the
use of the open-hearth furnaces which furnish a
slower method of burning out the carbon. Figure 74
is a diagrammatic representation of such a furnace.
Below the hearth of the furnace there are two pairs
of chambers, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, filled with a checkerwork
of bricks. Gas is passed through one chamber
<i>A</i>, and air through the other <i>B</i>, and they combine to
form a very intense flame above the hearth <i>E</i> in
which the metal is placed. The burnt gases pass
over and through the other pair of chambers, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>,
on their way to the stack. By this means the bricks
in the latter chambers are raised to a white
heat. Then the process is reversed; air flows
through the hot checkerwork of bricks in the
chamber <i>C</i> and gas through the hot checkerwork
in chamber <i>D</i>, and after combustion in the furnace
the burnt gases are drawn through the bricks of the
first pair of chambers. By alternating the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of flow the air and gas fed to the furnace are always
preheated by the stored-up heat of the previously
burned gases. While it takes but a few minutes to
convert cast iron into steel in the Bessemer converter,
the open-hearth process occupies from eight
to twelve hours.</p>

<p>The steel produced in the open-hearth furnaces is
poured into ingot molds. These are approximately
rectangular in section and slightly larger at the
bottom than at the top. They are open at the top
and bottom, but at the bottom rest upon a base
plate. As soon as the steel has hardened the plunger
of a stripping machine holds down the glowing
ingot while a pair of hooks lift off the mold, leaving
the ingot resting on the base plate.</p>

<h3>ROLLING INGOTS INTO RAILS</h3>

<p>In the manufacture of railroad rails the ingots
are placed on a traveling “table” consisting of a
series of rapidly turning rollers. These carry the
ingot to a pair of large steel rolls between which
it passes. The rolls compress the ingot slightly and
it is automatically turned over and passed through
a second pair of rolls. After passing through four
“stands” of rolls, turning over between each stand,
it is considerably reduced in cross-sectional area
and correspondingly lengthened. It is now termed
a “bloom.” The bloom goes through a series of
rollers which gradually reduce its section until it is
some forty feet long. Then it is cut in two and
each section passes through other rolls, until finally
it is reduced to the required rail section. Each section
is then about a hundred and twenty feet long
and the glowing writhing rail passes on to the saws
where it is cut into ten-yard lengths. A similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
process is employed in rolling other forms of rails
and in making steel plates and sheets.</p>

<h3>STEEL FOR BIG GUNS</h3>

<p>The largest machines employed in the steel industry
are those used for the manufacture of armor
and big guns. A modern large high-powered gun is
not a single solid casting or forging, but is made
up of a series of steel tubes that are shrunk one
upon another so that the inner tube is compressed.
The reason for this is that the explosives used are so
powerful that they would expand the inner tube or
lining of the gun beyond its elastic limit and in that
way enlarge the bore. By having it compressed to
start with it can expand farther without exceeding
the elastic limit. This expansion takes place so
suddenly that the lining rebounds or returns to its
original dimensions before the outer tubes have felt
the full pressure and they too are thus prevented
from being expanded too far. In some cases the
compression is effected by winding the gun with a
heavy wire of rectangular cross section.</p>

<h3>SQUEEZING OUT THE “PIPES”</h3>

<p>Steel for guns and armor is made in the open-hearth
furnace where the quality of the metal may
be regulated to a nicety. Gun tubes are cast in vertical
molds and during the cooling of the ingot it
is subjected to pressure so as to prevent segregation
and the forming of “pipes.” Pipes are cavities
that are liable to form in the center of the ingot due
to contraction during cooling. Steel, as we have
learned, is not pure iron, but an alloy, and the various
constituents have different temperatures of
solidifying, consequently they exhibit a tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
segregate. It is to overcome such tendencies that
a so-called “fluid” compressor is used. This is virtually
a hydraulic press with a plunger that bears
down on the fluid metal as it is solidifying. Modern
big guns are enormously large. A sixteen-inch 50-caliber
gun, for instance, is nearly seventy feet
long, consequently the ingot must be even longer
than this and the fluid compressor for so large a
piece must be correspondingly powerful. After the
ingot has been cast and cooled, the ends are cut
off and it is bored to form a tube. Then it is placed
in a furnace and raised to a white heat, after which
a bar or mandrel is inserted in the bore and the
tube is placed under the hydraulic forge press. This
is a very powerful machine with an immense hammer
that is actuated by hydraulic pressure. The
stroke of the hammer is carefully regulated so that
the forging as it is turned in the forge is subjected
to equal blows. In the forge the tube is roughly
formed to the dimensions it is eventually to have
when finished. The process of forging subjects
the metal to strains which must be relieved and so
the tube has to go to the annealing oven where it
is raised to a temperature which destroys crystallization.
In this oven it is allowed to cool very
slowly, letting the molecules of the metal adjust
and rearrange themselves. When the temperature
of the tube has been lowered to a certain point it
is taken out and plunged into a bath of oil. This
sudden cooling tempers the metal, giving it a high
degree of elasticity and tensile strength. Again
the tube must be annealed to relieve it of any
strains occasioned by the tempering, and then it
goes to the shop to receive its finish boring and
turning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>The process as here briefly described seems
simple enough, but we must not forget the enormous
size of these pieces and their tremendous
weight. They would be difficult enough to handle
when cold, but much of the work is done while the
pieces are at a white heat so that the men who control
and operate the machinery that handles the
big forgings must keep their distance. The casting,
annealing, and tempering operations are performed
with the piece in vertical position, and lofty machines
and cranes are required to deal with these
tall castings. A visit to a plant which manufactures
big guns is bound to impress the visitor with awe
and give him increased respect for the men who are
able to handle such huge masses of metal and also
for the men who have conceived and developed such
gigantic operations.</p>

<p class="pch">ANIMATED MACHINERY</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN MARKED contrast to the massive machinery
and apparatus described in the last chapter, and
fully as wonderful, is a class of machinery to which
we might apply the term “animated.” By this we
do not mean manikins or toys, but certain higher
types of machines which seem to be possessed of
powers that we should expect to find only in living
beings&mdash;machines that have a sense of touch, sight,
and hearing&mdash;machines that will reason out a
mathematical problem; that will talk; that have
the equivalent of a memory. In this broad classification
we may include such widely different machines
as the motion-picture camera and projector, and
that mysterious mechanism which seems animated
with strange powers of its own&mdash;- the gyroscope.</p>

<h3>MATHEMATICAL MACHINES</h3>

<p>Adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and
the working out of complex mathematical problems
by machine seems wonderful until we stop to reflect
that mathematics is the most precise and
mechanical of all sciences. In the simpler forms
these machines are mere counting mechanisms in
which the counting is done very rapidly by the aid
of intermeshing gears. The adding machine is in
no sense possessed of any reasoning power, but
blindly obeys the simplest of mechanical laws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
There are rows of wheels with numbers running
from 0 to 9 printed on their peripheries. One wheel
represents “digits,” the next “tens,” the next “hundreds,”
etc. The wheels are interconnected by
means of gearing so that when the digits wheel
makes a complete turn, the tens wheel makes 1-10th
of a turn, and when the tens wheel completes a
rotation the hundreds wheel makes 1-10th of a turn.
Keys numbered from “0” to “9” are provided,
which respectively turn each wheel through angles
from 1-10th to 10-10ths of a rotation. Thus suppose
the digit wheel has already been turned through
9-10ths of a rotation and registers the figure “9,”
and the “8” key is depressed, the wheel will be
given an additional turn of 8-10ths of a rotation
and will register the figure “7,” but the tens wheel
to the left will also move through 1-10th of a rotation,
so that the two wheels will register “17.” Such
is the underlying principle of the adding machine,
but various refinements are added. For instance, the
numbers that are being added are recorded in print,
and the total sum of the numbers is not printed
until the operator desires to foot up the column.</p>

<p>More complicated, of course, are the mathematical
machines which work out involved equations,
but they are all based on simple mechanical
operations. In the Weather Bureau at Washington
there is a tide-predicting machine, which has been
called a “great brass brain.” Its brass gears may
be set to allow for all the varying factors of apparent
solar and lunar motions, and they will work
out the tide for any past or future data in a few
moments, solving mechanically a mathematical
problem that, by hand, would take hours and hours
of weary figuring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<h3>HEARING AND TALKING WITH A MECHANICAL “EAR”</h3>

<p>It was in 1877 that Edison startled the world
with a machine that could actually talk. Others
had been working on this problem for years, but
they had been trying to copy the human mouth and
organs of speech. Edison attacked the problem
from a new angle. He was not aiming to produce
speech but to reproduce it. Let the human vocal
organs modulate the sound waves so that they
would produce spoken words; he would provide a
machine with no mouth but only an ear and a very
retentive memory which would listen to these sound
waves and make an impression of them on its soft
tinfoil or wax brain. Then, at any time by the
principle of “reversal,” the record could be made
the transmitter instead of the receiver of sound
waves, and it would actuate the ear so that it would
repeat the sound vibrations it had formerly received.
Thus Edison made the ear of his machine
serve the double office of hearing and talking. When
Edison’s phonograph was listening it had a sharp
needle attached to the ear-drum or diaphragm of
the sound box, which cut a hill and dale groove in
the brain or cylinder record of the machine; when
reproducing, a blunt needle was used which faithfully
followed the hills and dales of the groove
without cutting a path of its own.</p>

<p>The next notable improvement in the phonograph
was that of Emile Berliner, who in 1887 invented
the laterally vibrating needle which cut a zigzag
groove in the record instead of a hill-and-dale
groove. In other words, instead of having his
recording needle move in and out as in the Edison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
machine, it moved sidewise. He also invented the
flat-disk record, which has almost completely supplanted
the cylindrical record.</p>

<h3>MACHINES THAT PICTURE MOTION</h3>

<p>In a measure associated with the phonograph is
the motion-picture machine, a machine with an eye
and a retentive memory, which records on a sensitive
retina a series of pictures that it is able to
reproduce at any time. The recording of still
photographs is remarkable enough in itself, but
photography does not properly belong in a book on
machinery. The taking of motion pictures, however,
and the projection of these pictures upon the
screen, involves the use of machinery, and we must
refer to these machines briefly, owing to their
widespread use at the present time.</p>

<p>Long years ago it was observed that when a picture
is suddenly flashed before the eye an image
is impressed upon the retina, which persists for a
brief interval even after the picture itself has been
withdrawn from view. By preparing a series of
pictures of a figure which show it in progressive
positions and flashing these pictures in rapid succession
before the eye, persistence of vision will
bridge the gaps between pictures and the figure will
appear to move. This principle was first used as
early as 1834 in an ingenious toy known as “zoetrope,”
which consisted of a cardboard cylinder with
a series of pictures drawn on the inner surface.
There were slots cut in the cylinder through which
these pictures on the opposite face of the cylinder
could be seen. As the cylinder was revolved the
eye caught only momentary glimpses of these pictures,
one after the other, producing a sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
motion. In 1870, Henry Heyl of Philadelphia prepared
a progressive series of photographs each
separately posed before the camera. From these
he made glass positives and projected them on a
screen in rapid succession so that the picture appeared
to move. In 1880, Edward Muybridge set
up a battery of cameras and took a succession of
instantaneous pictures of a galloping horse. The
shutters were operated by strings stretched across
the course and as these were successively snapped
by the horse the pictures were progressively exposed.
Glass positives of these pictures were thrown
on the screen by means of a machine to which he
gave the formidable name “zoöpraxiscope.”</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM</h3>

<p>No one at that early date had thought of using
anything but glass plates, and they were difficult
to handle, both in the camera and in the projector.
It was not until 1887 that the celluloid film
was invented by Rev. Hannibal Goodwin, and then
it became possible for Edison to invent a camera
with a film that was intermittently moved so as to
take a series of pictures. From the negative thus
obtained a positive film was then made and placed
in a machine known as a “kinetoscope.” Looking
through a peephole in this machine the pictures
were flashed before the eye in rapid succession.
Finally, in 1893, C. Francis Jenkins, of Washington,
developed a projector similar to those now in
use by which the pictures could be thrown on a
screen. Thus was born the motion-picture industry
which has taken such a strong hold on the public.</p>

<p>It is now possible to project pictures in their
natural color so as to add to their realism, but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
more step is needed to give a sense of real life.
The figures on the screen must talk as well as
move. Efforts to combine the phonograph with
motion pictures have so far been only partially successful.
Perfect synchronism is very difficult to
obtain, but it is highly probable that obstacles
which hitherto have been most troublesome and
seemingly insurmountable will, in time, be overcome.
Then the “silent drama” will no longer be
silent and we shall have “animated pictures” that
will be really animated.</p>

<p>In addition to machines that talk we have machines
that hear&mdash;machines that will respond to
sound waves. A diaphragm flexed by sound waves
closes an electric circuit and starts the operation
of a machine. Some toys have been made which
operate on this principle. Experiments have been
made with a typewriter that will respond to a
spoken message, but so far they have not been attended
with much success. Boats have been built
whose steering gear may be controlled by sound
waves, but as yet nothing of commercial importance
has been developed in machines controlled
by sound.</p>

<h3>MACHINES THAT SEE</h3>

<p>Much more has been done with machines that
see. There is a delicate device known as a “sun
valve,” which is used on beacon lights so that as
soon as it grows dark or very foggy the lamp is
automatically lighted, and when the day dawns or
light breaks through the fog the light is extinguished.
The sun valve has two rods, one brightly
polished and the other a dead black. Light and its
attendant radiant heat waves are absorbed by the
black rod, but are reflected from the bright rod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
As a consequence, the black rod grows hotter than
the polished rod and expands. The difference of
expansion between the two rods is utilized to operate
a valve which controls the supply of gas to the
lamp. This valve is very sensitive and marvelously
responsive to variations of light.</p>

<p>There is a chemical element called selenium,
which is peculiarly sensitive to light. When light
shines upon selenium its electrical resistance is lowered,
and hence it can be used as a light-operated
valve to control the flow of electric current.</p>

<h3>A MACHINE THAT READS PRINT</h3>

<p>One of the most marvelous machines of the present
day is one which will actually read ordinary
printed type, uttering musical sounds that vary for
each letter, so that a blind man after learning this
new musical language can read any book. This
machine, known as the optophone, is the invention
of Prof. E. Fournier d’Albe, and was developed
to a commercial success last year (1920). With it
blind operators are able to read at the rate of
twenty-five words per minute.</p>

<p>The operation of this wonderful machine can best
be understood by reference to the accompanying
diagrams, Figures 75 and 76.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>There is an electric lamp in the machine before
which there is a disk that is revolved by a small
motor. In this disk there are five circular rows of
slots and the light shining through these slots is
cut up into five pulsating beams of light. These
beams are brought to a focus in a vertical row
upon the type page. From the paper they are reflected
to a selenium cell or bridge. The selenium
bridge forms part of the circuit of a telephone receiver
and the diaphragm is thus made to vibrate
at the same frequency as the light beams do. By
varying the number of slots in each row in the disk
the beams of light are given different periods of pulsation
or vibration and they produce a sound chord
or “scala” in the telephone receiver. The speed of
the disk and the disposition of the slots is so chosen
that the notes produced are <i>G</i> <i>C′</i> <i>D′</i> <i>E′</i> <i>G′</i> of the
musical scale. Only white paper reflects the light
beams; the black surface of the printed type absorbs
them. Thus, as the row of beams is swept
across a line of printed matter, the beams will be
extinguished in various orders of succession, or
simultaneously in accordance with the shape of the
particular type-character they encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The middle three beams correspond to notes <i>C′</i>,
<i>D′</i> and <i>E′</i>, and play upon the small letters, while <i>G′</i>
plays up the upper part of capital letters, and <i>G</i>
upon the tails of such letters as <i>y</i>, <i>p</i>, etc. If the
scala passes over the letter “V,” for instance, first
the top note <i>G′</i> is silenced, then <i>E′</i>, <i>D′</i>, <i>C′</i>, <i>D′</i>, <i>E′</i> and
<i>G′</i> in succession. This arrangement constitutes
what is known as the “white sounding” optophone,
because the full chord is sounded constantly, except
when the type matter is encountered.</p>

<p>To simplify the reading an improved type of
optophone has been made, which is known as the
“black-reading” optophone, With this machine
there is no sound produced except when the type is
encountered. The letter “V” is then identified by
the <i>sounding</i>, instead of the <i>silencing</i> of the notes
<i>G′</i>, <i>E′</i>, <i>D′</i>, <i>C′</i>, <i>E′</i> and <i>G′</i>. The letter “A” produces
the sounds <i>C′</i>, <i>D′</i>, <i>DE′</i>, <i>DG′</i>, <i>DE′</i>, <i>D′</i> and <i>C′</i>. This
result is obtained by using two selenium bridges,
as shown better in the side view, Figure 76. There
is a concave reflecting lens, which reflects half of
the light upon the second cell, known as the balancer
selenium bridge. Electric current passing
through the balancer opposes the current passing
through the main selenium bridge, and hence there
is silence in the telephone receiver when the scala
passes over plain white paper, but when type is
encountered and certain of the beams are not reflected
against the main selenium bridge the sounds
are produced through the balancer bridge.</p>

<p>The success of the optophone leads one to hope
that it may be but the forerunner of a machine that
will translate the whole world of light and color
into one of music, and permit the blind not only to
read by ear, but also to see their friends and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
surroundings through the sense of hearing. In fact
efforts to make such an apparatus preceded the invention
of the optophone.</p>

<h3>THE WILLFUL GYROSCOPE</h3>

<p>As intimated above, we have included the gyroscope
among the higher type of machines, because
it seems possessed of a stubborn will of its own,
and apparently defies the laws of gravity.</p>

<p>There is nothing mysterious about its mechanism.
It is merely a wheel with a heavy rim and
with its axis mounted in gimbals, so that it may
turn freely in any direction. The wheel, when at
rest, behaves no differently from any other mechanism.
But once the wheel is set to spinning at a high
velocity it seems to acquire marvelous powers and
obstinate notions of its own as to what it will do
and what it won’t do. You may lift it, or lower it,
or move it sideways in any direction, and it will
not show the least sign of rebellion so long as the
plane of its rotation is not deflected, but attempt to
twist its plane of rotation and it will resist with
the power of a giant. The resistance that even a
small gyroscope will develop is astounding. A
wheel weighing not more than 10 pounds may develop
so much energy that a man twenty times as
heavy pushing with all his might cannot turn it
over. Not only does it resist the push, but it actually
leans back against the pusher. Then it has
the peculiar habit of turning at right angles to the
direction in which it is pushed. Suppose, for instance,
the axis of the gyroscope is horizontal and
it is resting freely on a pair of supports, one at
each end. Remove one of the supports and the
gyroscope does not fall. To do so it would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
swing around the other point of support as a center;
in other words, the plane of rotation would
have to be turned angularly and such a motion the
gyroscope resists. The unsupported end of the
axis dips momentarily under the pull of gravity,
but immediately recovers and actually rises above
the horizontal, then it begins to revolve slowly in
a horizontal circle about the supported end of the
axis&mdash;a motion which is technically known as “precession”.
The pull of gravity exerted in a downward
direction results in a horizontal motion at
right angles thereto. It seems as if the gyroscope
was bidding defiance to laws that govern other objects,
but, of course, such is not the case. The gyroscope
is as submissively obedient to the laws of
gravity as any other object or machine, but the
forces which act upon it are so complicated that it
is difficult for one to comprehend them without
study. In fact, it is almost impossible to explain
the strange behavior of a gyroscope without the
use of mathematics that is too involved to be presented
in this book.</p>

<p>Of course, the underlying cause of gyroscopic
action is inertia; <i>i. e.</i>, the tendency of a body to
retain its state of rest or uniform motion. A bullet
is forced out of a gun by the sudden expansion of
gases behind it, but after it leaves the muzzle and
the influence of the gases, why does it keep on
traveling? We may just as well reverse the question
and ask why it should ever stop. Having once
acquired a certain velocity it keeps that velocity
because of its inertia or mechanical helplessness,
and it would keep on going forever were it not for
the resistance offered by the air and the pull of
gravity, which gradually draws it down to earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
It takes a deal of energy to divert the bullet from
its course. In a gyroscope we have a similar
condition.</p>

<h3>FORCES DEVELOPED IN A GYROSCOPE</h3>

<p>We may conceive of a gyroscope as consisting of
a stream of bullets all tied to a center, so that they
fly around in a circle. Any effort to deflect the bullets
out of their course will be resisted by each bullet
as it comes to the deflector. Here each bullet
acts individually, but in a gyroscope wheel the
equivalent of the stream of bullets is a solid rim,
each particle of which is rigidly connected to every
other particle, and so the whole wheel immediately
feels the deflecting force and resists it. As long as
the wheel is maintained in its own plane of rotation,
or moved into parallel planes, there is such
a perfect balance of all forces that no more resistance
is offered to the motion of the wheel as a whole
than would be offered by any other object of equal
mass. But when the wheel’s plane of rotation is
moved angularly, a complicated series of forces is
developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 77.&mdash;SOME OF THE FORCES DEVELOPED IN A GYROSCOPE
WHEN ITS PLANE OF ROTATION IS SUBJECTED TO
ANGULAR MOTION</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some idea of the nature of these forces and why
they give rise to precession may be understood by
reference to the diagram, Figure 77. Here we have
a disk with a heavy rim turning on the axis X, X′.
At <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are four particles whose flights
we are going to consider. Suppose the wheel to be
at rest; then if <i>X, X′</i> is tilted in the direction of the
arrows <i>x</i> <i>x′</i>, the wheel will turn about the line
<i>Y Y′</i>; <i>D</i> will move forward toward <i>D′</i>, and <i>B</i> backward
toward <i>B′</i>, but <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> will remain where
they are. Now, suppose, the wheel to be revolving
clockwise, or in the direction <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, then the
particle <i>A</i> will pursue a spiral course that will
bring it to <i>B′</i>, and <i>C</i> will pursue a spiral course
that will bring it to <i>D′</i>. However, particle <i>D</i> will
have an irregular course, as indicated by the dotted
line, starting first to move forward and then curving
back toward <i>A</i>. The same will be true of <i>B</i>,
except in the reverse direction. The course of particles
<i>D</i> and <i>B</i> is, therefore, materially different
from that of <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>. Now, the particle <i>D</i> will
resist being deflected from its course and will
develop an opposing force represented by the
arrow <i>d</i>. A moment later this is reversed as the
particle bends back toward the axis <i>Y Y′</i>, and we
may represent the new force by the arrow <i>d′</i>. It
may be proved that the force <i>d′</i> is more powerful
than that of <i>d</i>. The particle <i>A</i> in the meantime
exerts a force opposing its deflection, which is represented
by the arrow <i>a</i>. On the other half of the
wheel there are similar but opposite forces, <i>b</i>, <i>b′</i> and
<i>c</i>. The sum of these forces gives the wheel a
tendency to turn about the axis <i>Z Z′</i>. To avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
complicating our diagram with too many arrows,
we had better refer to a new diagram (Figure 78)
which shows only the resultant of the forces developed.
The application of the forces <i>x</i> <i>x′</i>, which
would have turned the wheel on the axis <i>Y Y′</i>, had
it been stationary, have resulted in the development
of forces <i>z</i> <i>z′</i> at right angles to <i>x</i> <i>x′</i>, tending to
turn the wheel about the axis <i>Z Z′</i>. Now, if we go
through the same processes of reasoning as before,
it will be evident that the forces <i>z</i> <i>z′</i> will result in
a third set of forces <i>y</i> <i>y′</i> at right angles to <i>z</i> <i>z′</i> tending
to turn the wheel about the axis <i>Y Y′</i>. The
forces <i>y</i> <i>y′</i> exactly balance the forces <i>x</i> <i>x′</i>, and hence
the wheel does not turn about the axis <i>Y Y′</i> in
response to the original forces, but starts instead
to revolve slowly about the axis <i>Z Z</i>. Because the
forces <i>x</i> <i>x′</i> and <i>y</i> <i>y′</i> balance each other, there is no
fourth couple developed and hence no opposition
to the forces <i>z</i> <i>z′</i>.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">FIG. 78.&mdash;DIAGRAM EXPLAINING PRECESSIONAL MOVEMENT
OF A GYROSCOPE</p>
</div></div>

<p>The gyroscope was used as a toy ages ago. The
top, which is one form of gyroscope, was a favorite
plaything of ancient Egypt. But although known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
these many centuries, it is only in the past few
years that any real effort has been made to set the
top to work. Because it persists in maintaining its
plane of rotation it has proved most useful on submarine
torpedoes to control the rudder and hold the
torpedo on a true course to its target.</p>

<h3>THE GYROSCOPE AS A COMPASS</h3>

<p>Another most important use for the gyroscope is
found in the submarine itself. The needle of a
magnetic compass is kept pointing north by action
of the magnetic lines of force which surround this
earth. Whenever a large mass of iron is placed
near the compass the magnetic field is distorted and
the compass needle is deflected from the true north.
On modern steel vessels the compass has to be carefully
corrected by using iron masses to counterbalance
other disturbing masses. However, in a
submarine the whole shell of the vessel is of steel
and the magnetic lines of force flow along this shell.
The compass needle is virtually insulated from the
terrestrial magnetism by the surrounding steel
hull. But, fortunately, the gyroscope may be used
as a compass and it is in no way affected by magnetism.
Once the gyroscope is set spinning with its
axis pointing to the North Pole of the heavens it
will continue to point in that direction no matter
how devious a course the vessel may pursue. If
pointed in some other direction, the precessional
forces set up by the rotation of the earth will turn
it due north. As the vessel rolls or pitches, disturbing
precessional movements are likely to be set
up. These are overcome by special mechanism, so
that the gyroscopic compass may now be depended
upon as a perfectly reliable instrument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<h3>PREVENTING SHIPS FROM ROLLING</h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable recent developments
of the gyroscope is its use as a stabilizer in ships
to keep them from rolling in a heavy sea. A comparatively
small wheel is mounted in the hold of
the vessel with perfect freedom to turn in any
direction. If the wheel is clamped so that it cannot
precess, the vessel will roll and pitch, but the
instant the gyroscope is released it exerts its
wonderful powers. The ship rides smoothly and
its groaning and creaking ceases, showing that it
is no longer subjected to severe strains. Of course,
it rises and falls with the waves, but it maintains
an even keel as if sailing in smooth water. The
object of stabilizing a ship is not merely to cater
to the comfort of passengers who are subject to
seasickness, but to save wear and tear on the vessel
and also to economize time and fuel. An unstabilized
ship riding a heavy sea pursues a very
sinuous course; in other words, it must travel
farther than it would in smooth water. The rudder
must constantly be turned to keep the ship on its
course, and this acts as a drag on the progress of
the ship, slowing it down and wasting the power
of the engine. As the ship wallows in the sea it
displaces much more water than it does when riding
on an even keel and here there is a further loss.
It has been estimated that a 15,000-ton vessel running
at 18 knots may waste as much as 1,000 to
1,200 horsepower in a heavy sea. If stabilized with
a gyroscope, practically all this wasted horsepower
would be saved at the expense of a very
small amount of power used in keeping the gyroscope
spinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The first man to stabilize a ship with a gyroscope
was Dr. Schlick, who demonstrated the
powers of this mysterious mechanism in 1906. His
stabilizer, however, was not sensitive enough to
provide perfect stabilizing. The ship had to roll
some before the gyroscope exerted its corrective
forces. Recently, however, Mr. Elmer A. Sperry
has improved the stabilizer, making it so sensitive
that there is practically no rolling or pitching of
the vessel.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the gyroscope may be used not
only to keep a ship from rolling, but also to make
it roll. Should a vessel run upon a mud flat it
may be rocked by braking or accelerating the precessional
motion of the gyroscope. In this way the
ship may work itself out of the mud bank. Ice
breakers are equipped with gyroscopes, so that they
may be rolled to prevent them from being frozen
into an ice pack and to assist them in crushing their
way through the ice.</p>

<h3>THE MONO-RAIL CAR</h3>

<p>In 1907 a sensation was created by the exhibition
of a car which ran on a single rail. The inventor
of this monorail car was Mr. Louis Brennan.
The public was astonished at the ease with
which this car maintained its balance on the rail,
leaning in as it rounded a curve to keep its equilibrium.
Passengers could move about at will without
the slightest danger of upsetting the car; in fact, if
a heavy weight was placed on one side of the car
that side would rise rather than fall. The car could
run with equal ease upon a cable of a crooked pipe
line. The gyroscope that maintained the balance of
the car consisted of a couple of small wheels which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
revolved in a vacuum chamber at the rate of 7,000
revolutions per minute. Once started, little power
was required to keep them going. Interesting as
this car was, it did not offer sufficient advantages
over the present-day double rail cars and locomotives
to justify its development on a commercial
scale. Although witnesses of the exhibition marveled
at the strange spectacle of this mechanical
tight-rope walker, they did not realize that they
themselves had had gyroscopic cars in their midst
for years. The gyroscopic action of the wheels of
a motorcycle is very marked. It is this action
which is mainly responsible for holding the
machine upright. The same is true of a bicycle,
although the gyroscopic effect is not quite so
marked, because of the lower velocity of the wheels.
However, we all know that any tendency for the
machine to fall to one side or the other may be
corrected by a slight turn of the front wheel in
that direction which at once has the effect of bringing
the bicycle back to vertical position.</p>

<h3>THE AUTOMATIC AEROPLANE PILOT</h3>

<p>Still another recent development of the gyroscope
is its use as an “automatic pilot” on aeroplanes. Two
sensitive gyroscopes are used to stabilize the aeroplane.
If a gust of wind tends to tilt the machine,
the gyroscopes immediately sense the deviation and
by closing electrical circuits operate the ailerons to
bring the machine back to a horizontal plane.</p>

<p>An aviator possesses a certain sense of balance
which is highly developed by experience and long
practice, but at its best it does not begin to compare
with sense of balance possessed by the gyroscope.
Not only will it keep the machine from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
tipping laterally, but it will also hold it on a level
keel and can be used to steer the aeroplane in any
desired direction, so that the human pilot may surrender
the helm to the faithful mechanical pilot
with perfect confidence in the ability of this animated
machine to hold the aeroplane on a true
course despite the vagaries of the wind. While this
is theoretically possible, in practice certain difficulties
are encountered which up to the present
have prevented gyroscopic control of aeroplanes
from being entirely successful.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pch">HEAT VACUUMS</p>
<p class="drop-cap04">IN THE preceding chapter we dealt with high
temperatures and their employment in melting,
molding, and working steel into useful forms. It
will be well for us to pause here to consider temperatures
at the other end of the thermometer
scale, how they are obtained, and the important
part they play in modern civilization.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely correct to speak of producing
“cold.” We are apt to forget that cold is
merely absence of heat. Strictly speaking, there
is nothing cold on earth. Everything is more or
less hot. A piece of ice at 32 degrees F. is hot compared
with a lump of frozen alcohol, and the latter
at its freezing point is hot compared with a lump
of frozen air, while air at its freezing point is hot
compared with a lump of solid helium. In other
words, frozen alcohol will be melted by the heat in
the ice; frozen air will be melted by the heat in
frozen alcohol, and frozen helium will be fused by
the heat in frozen air. Everything contains heat,
and one object is colder than another only because
it contains less heat.</p>

<p>Of course, the temperature of ice may vary.
One block of ice may be ten, fifty, or a hundred
degrees warmer than another, but ice cannot be
heated above 32 degrees F. at the normal pressure
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>Ice is really a partial heat vacuum, a chamber
partially exhausted, into which heat will flow if it
gets a chance. We pack it away in sawdust, granulated
cork, or other materials through which heat
can with difficulty penetrate, and then in hot
weather cakes of ice are placed in our household
refrigerators, so that the heat that is in our food
will have something to flow into. When we place
our hands near a cake of ice, they feel cool and it
seems as if ice radiated cold just as a stove radiates
heat; but, of course, such is not the case. The
heat of our hands radiates more rapidly in the
direction of the cake of ice than in other directions,
because there is a partial heat vacuum
for the heat to flow into and the result is a sensation
of cold.</p>

<p>We no longer depend upon cold winters for our
supply of ice. We have learned how to pump heat
and we can make heat vacuums, anywhere and at
any time, even in the heart of the tropics, and
regions in which no natural ice is ever obtainable
have the benefits of refrigeration. Furthermore,
we are not dependent upon ice for cooling
foods. In many cases it is not necessary or even
desirable to reduce temperatures to the freezing
point of water. A moderate chilling is all that is
required for certain foods. By the proper use of
refrigerating machinery any degree of temperature
may be obtained and maintained. To-day small
refrigerating plants are constructed for domestic
purposes, so as to render the housewife independent
of the ice man.</p>

<p>With refrigerator cars and refrigerating plants
on shipboard, fruit from the far west and from
tropical lands may be brought to our breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
table. Meats from northern slaughterhouses may be
transported in perfect condition into hot southern
climes. There are also certain industries which
are dependent on the use of the low temperatures.
In breweries, dairies, margarine factories, etc.,
refrigeration is of the utmost importance, and refrigerating
machinery is used for cooling and drying
the air blast for blast furnaces.</p>

<p>In some few places refrigerating machinery is
used to cool buildings in warm weather and make
life more bearable in summer weather. It is
highly probable that refrigeration of dwellings will
be more and more extensively developed. In winter
time we can make the climate in our houses anything
we please. Why should we not control the
indoor climate in summer time as well?</p>

<h3>ABSOLUTE ZERO</h3>

<p>The volume of a gas varies inversely in accordance
with the pressure to which it is subjected,
and also directly according to the temperature. If
we start with a gas at the freezing point (32 degrees
F.) and reduce its temperature 1 degree (or
to 31 degrees F.), we find that the volume of the
gas is reduced 1/492.6 of its original volume, provided,
of course, that we do not vary the pressure
on it. In fact, for every reduction of 1 degree below
the freezing point there is a reduction of 1/492.6 of
its volume, and for every degree of increased temperature
there is an increase of 1/492.6 of the
volume. From this it is assumed that at 492.6
degrees below the freezing point, or 460.6 degrees
below zero F., we will reach the absolute zero,
or the point at which there is no more heat in
the gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>We have not yet succeeded in reaching the
extreme of low temperature, although we have
come very near it in laboratory experiments.
Helium is liquefied at -448 degrees F., which is
very near to the absolute zero. At the other end of
the scale we have attained enormously high temperatures.
The heat of the electric arc, for instance,
is between 6,500 and 7,200 degrees F., and
that is the highest degree of temperature that we
have been able so far to attain.</p>

<p>Human life occupies a very limited zone in this
range of temperatures. We must maintain our
blood at a temperature of 98 degrees F. A variation
of 8 degrees either way is fatal. By piling on
heat insulators, such as fur clothing, to retain the
heat of our bodies and keep it from flowing out too
rapidly, we can maintain the blood temperature at
98 while the surrounding atmosphere may be 70 or
80 degrees below zero. There are internal fires
within us that generate heat which radiates from
the body, and by checking this radiation by suitable
clothing we can maintain our blood at the
normal temperature.</p>

<p>But what can we do when the surrounding temperature
is higher than blood heat? The outside
heat may be kept from flowing in by surrounding
ourselves with heat-insulating clothing, but the
internal heat then has no means of radiating away
from our bodies; it accumulates, and we become
overheated. However, Nature provides a cooling
system in the perspiration which oozes from our
pores, and as this evaporates it cools the skin and
enables us to maintain our normal blood heat,
although submerged in an atmosphere of a higher
temperature. If the air is dry, the evaporation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
more rapid and the cooling is greater than in a
moist atmosphere. That is why a temperature of
105 degrees on our Western plains may be more
endurable than a temperature of 95 degrees in the
moist atmosphere of New York. The importance
of keeping down the temperature of the blood is
particularly appreciated by physicians, and for this
reason the earliest attempts at artificial cooling
were made by physicians.</p>

<h3>EARLY USES OF LOW TEMPERATURES</h3>

<p>Very early in his history man discovered fire,
learned how to kindle it and how to use it for his
good. That discovery placed him immediately on
a level far above the beasts. However, it is only in
comparatively recent times that he has learned the
uses of low temperatures. Nature’s stores of ice
were drawn upon, and methods of preserving ice
through warm weather were discovered in ancient
times. Nero had ice houses built for him in Rome,
but he could stock these buildings only with the ice
that nature furnished him. Freezing mixtures of
salt and ice, such as we use in our ice-cream
freezers to-day to obtain temperatures far below
the freezing point of water, were probably known
in early times, but the ancients did not know how
to produce ice.</p>

<p>Artificial ice was probably first made in India,
where it has long been the practice to produce ice
by evaporation. Water is placed in shallow pans
and then dry air is circulated over it, causing so
rapid a vaporization as to cool the water to the
freezing point. The idea of cooling water by evaporation
belongs to very ancient times. Water
placed in porous earthen vessels was found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
cooler than water kept in water-tight jars. The
moisture that escaped through the vessel would
evaporate, and in so doing draw heat out of the
vessel and its contents. To-day campers keep
water cool by putting it in canvas buckets and
hanging the buckets in the wind, so that the
moisture oozing through the canvas will evaporate
quickly.</p>

<p>It was not until 1755 that a mechanical means
of producing low temperatures was developed.
The inventor was Dr. Cullen, and he used an evaporation
system, expediting the evaporation by producing
a partial vacuum over the water. But
nearly a century elapsed before the first commercially
successful refrigerating machine was built.
Even then the advantages of artificial refrigeration
were not fully realized, and it was not until
late in the last century that real progress was made.
Since then the development of artificial refrigeration
has been truly remarkable.</p>

<h3>HEAT AND MECHANICAL ENERGY</h3>

<p>There is a definite relation between heat and
mechanical energy, in fact the two are mutually
convertible. The amount of heat required to raise
the temperature of a pound of water 1 degree F.
is called a British thermal unit or a B. t. u. This
measure is taken at 39.1 degrees F., because at
that temperature water is at its densest. Since heat
and mechanical energy are mutually convertible, we
can express foot-pounds or horsepower in B. t. u.
One B. t. u. is equivalent to 778 foot-pounds of
energy. In other words, the amount of heat that
would raise the temperature of a pound of water
1 degree F. would, if converted into mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
energy, be sufficient to raise a weight of 778 pounds
to a height of one foot, or one pound to a height
of 778 feet. A horsepower is equivalent to 2,545
B. t. u. per hour.</p>

<p>Heat from burning coal is used to generate
steam, and this in turn is used to operate a steam
engine and thus heat is converted into mechanical
energy (unfortunately most of the original heat
units in the coal are wasted, as was pointed out in
a previous chapter); but heat will not flow from
one body into another of higher temperature without
the expenditure of mechanical energy. It
always flows from a hot body into a cold one, and
not from the cold body into the hot one, unless it is
actually pumped up to the higher heat level by
some mechanical means. A refrigerating machine
is actually a heat pump with which we produce a
partial heat vacuum.</p>

<p>Whenever a gas is compressed, heat is generated.
Anyone who has operated a tire pump knows how
hot the pump becomes from the heat that is seemingly
squeezed out of the compressed air. As was
noted in Chapter VIII, heat is liable to give trouble
in an air compressor, and sometimes the temperature
rises to such a point that there is an explosion
of the air and the vapors coming from the oil used
to lubricate the machine. The compressed air is
therefore cooled by means of water jackets or coils
of pipe through which water is passed. In this way
the excess heat is carried off. When, however,
cooled compressed air is relieved of pressure and
allowed to expand again the process is reversed.
A partial heat vacuum is formed and heat from
surrounding objects flows into the vacuum. In other
words, the surrounding objects are cooled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<h3>COLD AIR MACHINES</h3>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p>It is a simple matter to make a machine which
will alternately compress, cool, and expand air in
such a way as to produce a lowered temperature.
Such a machine is indicated diagrammatically in
Figure 79. There are two cylinders, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and a
condenser at <i>C</i>. When the piston <i>a</i> in cylinder <i>A</i>
descends it compresses the air in the cylinder; this
air flows into the condenser <i>C</i>. There is a coil of
pipe in this condenser through which water circulates.
This carries off the heat of compression and
then a valve is opened which permits the cooler air
to pass off into cylinder <i>B</i>. As the air expands in
this cylinder it becomes chilled. This chilled air is
then forced out of cylinder <i>B</i> by means of piston <i>b</i>
and flows into the refrigerator or cold storage
room <i>D</i>. As the air is liable to take up moisture
and to introduce objectionable vapors from oil
used to lubricate the pumps, it is usually confined
in pipes in the refrigerator and then returned to
the cylinder <i>A</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a type of a refrigerating machine that is
used very extensively on ships for chilling perishable
foods. However, air has only a very low capacity
for heat, and in order to obtain an appreciable
amount of refrigeration very large volumes of air
must be handled. This means that cold-air
machines must be very large and bulky. The
efficiency of such machines is low, but they find
favor on shipboard because there are no inflammable
or poisonous gases to be dealt with. In the standard
machine of the United States Navy air is
compressed to 260 pounds; and in the expansion is
raised to 60 pounds pressure, which is enough to
reduce the temperature to between 70 to 90 degrees
below zero.</p>

<h3>LATENT HEAT</h3>

<p>Far more efficient are the machines which utilize
latent heat. As explained in a previous chapter,
whenever a solid is converted into a liquid or into
a gas a certain amount of heat is absorbed and
stored up in such a way as not to become apparent
to the senses or to a thermometer. Such heat is
known as “latent heat.” For instance, we can add
a pound of water at 50 degrees temperature to a
pound of water at 200 degrees, and the mixture will
have a temperature of 125 degrees, or the mean of
200 + 50 degrees. But a pound of ice at 32 degrees
mixed with a pound of water at 200 degrees
will not give us 116 degrees ((200+32)/2), but only 44½
degrees. In other words, about 143 heat units will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
be rendered latent in converting solid water into
liquid water, reducing the temperature of the water
to 57 degrees and then the mean of 57 and 32 is
44.5 (200-143=57, (57+32)/2 = 44½). A more
striking experiment is to mix a pound of water
cooled to 32 degrees F. with a pound of water at
175 degrees F., and the result will be two pounds
of water at 103.5 degrees, but if we mix a pound of
chopped ice at 32 degrees F. with a pound of water
at 175 degrees F., the result will be two pounds of
water cooled to the freezing point.</p>

<p>In passing from a liquid into a gas water absorbs
far more heat and renders it latent. For
each pound of water converted into steam at atmospheric
pressure 970 B. t. u. are absorbed. This
storage of latent heat is utilized to good advantage
in refrigerating machinery. The vacuum
machine invented by Dr. Cullen in 1755 was a
latent heat machine.</p>

<h3>VACUUM MACHINES</h3>

<p>As we have observed before, the boiling point of a
liquid depends upon the pressure to which it is subjected.
Under the normal atmospheric pressure of
14.7 pounds per inch the boiling point of water is
212 degrees F., but if the pressure be increased
the boiling point rises, and if it be reduced the
boiling point is lowered. In a partial vacuum of
ten pounds absolute pressure the boiling point is
193.2 degrees, at one pound it is 102.1 degrees, and
if the pressure is reduced to .089 pound water will
boil at 32 degrees, or its normal freezing point.
Dr. Cullen, by exhausting the air from a vessel containing
water, made the water boil or vaporize at
a low temperature. In order to boil it had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
absorb heat, and not being supplied with any external
heat it had to draw upon itself, thus producing
ice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 80.&mdash;DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF A VACUUM REFRIGERATING
MACHINE</p>

</div></div>

<p>Dr. Cullen’s machine has been improved upon by
using various chemical substances to absorb the
water vapor. Such a machine is shown in Figure 80.
The vacuum chamber <i>A</i> is partly filled with brine,
which may be cooled below the freezing point of
pure water without congealing. A pump, <i>B</i>, maintains
a vacuum in the chamber. In the upper part
of the vacuum chamber there is a vessel, <i>C</i>, into
which sulphuric acid is sprayed from a reservoir,
<i>D</i>. This acid has a strong affinity for water vapor
and hastens the evaporation by absorbing the
vapor with which it comes in contact. The mixed
sulphuric acid and water flows over into a receiver,
<i>E</i>. The acid is reconcentrated by steam heat so
that it can be used over again. However, this feature
of the process is not shown in the diagram.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Brine from the chamber <i>A</i> passes through a coil of
pipe <i>F</i> in the tank <i>G</i>, where the ice is made, and it
is returned to the vacuum chamber by an injector
<i>H</i>, which at the same time introduces fresh water
into the chamber to take the place of that
absorbed by the acid. The fresh water and
brine enter as a spray at <i>I</i>, so as to increase
the rate of evaporation.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 81.&mdash;ORIGINAL ABSORPTION MACHINE</p>
</div></div>

<h3>THE ABSORPTION PROCESS</h3>

<p>Another form of refrigeration is known as the
absorption system, and strangely enough direct
heat is applied to the machine in one place in order
to abstract heat from it in another. A diagrammatic
representation of the first machine of this
type (which was invented by Frederick Carré) is
shown in Figure 81. Two vessels, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, are employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
which are connected by a tube <i>C</i>. The vessel
<i>A</i> contains ammonia solution. A lamp, <i>D</i>, is
placed under the vessel <i>A</i>. Sufficient heat is produced
to vaporize the ammonia, whose boiling point
is very low, and distill it out of the water in the
solution. It passes through tube <i>C</i> into vessel <i>B</i>.
This vessel is surrounded by a tank, <i>E</i>, containing
cold water, which condenses the ammonia vapor
into liquid ammonia, then the process is reversed.</p>

<p>The circulation of water through tank <i>E</i> is
checked and water from pipe <i>F</i> is sprayed on vessel
<i>A</i>. This cools the contents of vessel <i>A</i>, producing
a partial vacuum. The ammonia in chamber
<i>B</i> boils and its vapors pass back into chamber <i>A</i>,
where they are reabsorbed by the water in that
chamber. The rapid vaporization in chamber <i>B</i>
absorbs heat from the immediate surroundings and
will freeze water placed in the tank <i>E</i>.</p>

<p>In commercial practice the absorption system is
very extensively employed. The ammonia is placed
in a large cylinder known as a generator and is
heated by steam coils. The ammonia vapor passes
through an analyzer which traps any water vapor
it may contain, and then it goes through a series of
condensing coils, which are cooled by water. In
these condensing coils the ammonia vapor is
liquefied by the pressure in the generator and collects
in a receiver, whence it passes through an expansion
valve into the cooling coils in the brine
tank. From the cooling coils the ammonia gas
passes back through an absorber which reverses
the operation of the generator. Here weak aqua
ammonia is sprayed on the ammonia gas and absorbs
it. The rich ammonia solution is then
pumped into the generator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several auxiliary apparatus which are
omitted in this brief description in the interest
of clarity.</p>

<h3>THE COMPRESSION SYSTEM</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-384.jpg" width="450" height="232"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc450">FIG. 82.&mdash;DIAGRAMMATIC VIEW OF A COMPRESSION MACHINE</p>
</div></div>

<p>One more type of refrigerating machine remains
to be described and that is the compression type.
This was invented by Jacob Perkins in 1834, but
was not developed into a commercial machine
until 1850. This machine is the most important of
them all. In some respects it is like the absorption
process, but in place of adding direct heat a compressing
machine is employed. Figure 82 illustrates
the system diagrammatically. At <i>A</i> is the compressor
which compresses ammonia gas. The gas
which is heated by the compressor is then cooled
and liquefied in the condenser <i>B</i>. Thence it passes
into a brine tank <i>C</i>, where it expands and absorbs
heat. From this point it is drawn back into the
compressor, thus completing the cycle. In other
words, the ammonia must absorb as much heat from
the brine as is taken out of it at the condenser.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="pch">ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION</p>

<p class="drop-cap14">AT THE VERY beginning of this book we observed
that war is a most potent stimulus to invention
among primitive men. Despite all our advances in
civilization we still have our wars, each more dreadful
than the preceding one; for each important conflict
brings forth new engines of destruction or stimulates
the invention of new death-dealing machines
which are developed during intervals of peace. So
terrible has modern war become that with each great
conflict it has seemed as if its very dreadfulness
would stay the hand of the invader and make him
hesitate to expose his men to the horrible monsters
which science and invention have created. To-day,
after a titanic struggle which cost millions of
human lives, which destroyed billions of dollars’
worth of property, and which made itself felt to the
remotest corners of the earth, serious efforts are
being made to banish war, but at the same time
inventors here and abroad are busy inventing new
and more powerful engines of death, and the prospects
are that the next big war, should there ever
be one, will be even more horrible and destructive
than the one we have just passed through.</p>

<p>Fortunately engines of death are not the only
inventions produced by war. Many machines, apparatus,
and processes are originated or developed
which have a distinct value in time of peace; hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
war is a great constructive as well as a destructive
agency. In this respect the great World War was no
exception and we are already reaping benefits which
in a small way compensate for the havoc that was
wrought. It advanced scientific research to a point
it would not have reached in fifty years of peace.
The stimulus was felt in every field of science from
chemistry to acoustics, from geology to meteorology.
Wonderful progress was made in radiotelephony,
in submarine navigation, in aviation, and there
were scores of inventions which will add to our comfort
and aid us in the mastery of Nature.</p>

<p>Many of these inventions have already been described;
others do not properly belong in this volume
as they have to do chiefly with electricity or chemistry.
In this chapter we shall take up mainly the
machines built for the purpose of destroying men
and their works.</p>

<h3>PRIMITIVE “ENGINES” OF WAR</h3>

<p>Of course the main objects of war are offense and
defense, the destruction of the opponent and the protection
of one’s self. This first fighting was a hand-to-hand
struggle which gave way to fighting at a
distance as spears and arrows were invented.
Shields and armor were then invented to ward off
these missiles. Cities were surrounded with walls
to hold off the enemy. Then came the Roman war
“engines,” catapults and battering rams, to destroy
the walls and towers which would enable the besiegers
to fight on an equal level and in personal
contact with the besieged. Although a battle might
start with long-distance fighting it was always a
hand-to-hand encounter that clinched the victory.
Even to-day, although we have our big guns which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
fight at ranges of five to twenty miles, it is the rifle
or bayonet which wins or loses the battle.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF GUNPOWDER</h3>

<p>The introduction of gunpowder from China in the
fifteenth century did not immediately revolutionize
warfare. It was used only in cannon or mortars
for hurling large stones at city walls. The range of
those cannon was so limited and the time it took to
load and fire them was so great that they were of
little use on an open battlefield. A cannon, although
a comparatively powerful offensive weapon, was
helpless against attack and was only suitable for
use in forts or behind breastworks. Later when its
range was increased and it came to be used on the
battlefield it had to be protected from capture by
men supplied with small arms.</p>

<p>This defect of the cannon also applied to the use
of the hand gun. Its range was small and consequently
the blunderbuss type was invented to spread
the charge of shot as much as possible so as to tear
a wide gap in the enemy’s line and prevent it from
closing in upon the operator of the gun. But the
loading and firing of these early firearms was extremely
slow and the battle-ax and even the arrow
and the crossbow were much more effective
weapons. So unreliable were the muskets of our
Revolutionary War that in battle more dependence
was placed upon the bayonet than the firearm.</p>

<h3>THE SPINNING BULLET</h3>

<p>Three important improvements were necessary to
make the small gun a really effective weapon. First
was the invention of a reliable means of igniting
the powder; second the rifling of the barrel so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
the bullet would not tumble but would hold a true
course, and finally the invention of a cartridge and
a rifle that could be loaded from the breech. These
improvements were not completely effected until the
time of the Civil War. Since then there have been
further marked improvements: The power of cartridges
has been increased; the bullets have been
given a stream-line form so as to increase the range
of the rifle and its power of penetration; the rifle
has been equipped with a magazine for carrying a
number of cartridges; and a simple mechanism has
been provided for discharging empty shells and inserting
fresh cartridges in a minimum of time.</p>

<p>Gyroscopic action plays a very important part in
the flight of a bullet or shell. The spiral grooves
cut in the bore of the rifle give the projectile a twist
that sets it to spinning rapidly. The spinning bullet
is virtually a gyroscope and maintains its axis in the
line of flight. Hence it is possible to use a long
pointed bullet instead of the round ball of earlier
days and to give the projectile a shape that will enable
it to cut through the air with comparatively
little resistance. The same bullet fired from a smooth
bore gun would begin to tumble and would encounter
so much air resistance that it would fall short in
the space of a few hundred feet, besides which it
would wander far off its course.</p>

<h3>MACHINE GUNS</h3>

<p>A rifle is really a machine for hurling small projectiles.
During the Civil War a Chicago physician
named Gatling fell to pondering over the inefficiency
of using a machine that would fire only one bullet
at a time with a considerable interval of time between
shots for reloading, and he hit upon the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of developing a machine that would discharge a continuous
stream of bullets. So he built a ten-barrel
revolving gun operated by a hand crank. The barrels
were automatically loaded and fired one after
the other. Although it was slow to accept the
Gatling machine gun, the U. S. Army after once
accepting it was loath to give it up even after better
machine guns were invented.</p>

<h3>UTILIZING THE KICK OF A GUN</h3>

<p>In the Gatling gun hand power was required to
operate the loading, firing and shell-ejecting mechanism,
but it occurred to another inventor that a
small portion of the energy developed in exploding
the cartridge could very well be utilized to replace
the hand power and thus make the machine gun
completely automatic. It was Hiram Maxim who
first carried out this idea to a successful conclusion.
When a rifle is fired the suddenly expanding gases
push back against the breech of the gun with just
as much pressure as they do against the bullet and
this shows itself in the recoil or “kick” of the gun.
Maxim utilized the kick of the gun to cock the gun,
open the breech, eject the empty shell, take a fresh
cartridge out of a magazine belt, insert it in the
breech chamber, lock the breech and fire the gun.
All these operations occupied but an instant of time
and the gun kept on firing as long as the belt of
cartridges held out.</p>

<p>John M. Browning, inventor of the Colt gun, instead
of using the recoil, employed a small portion
of the gases to operate the mechanism. A minute
hole in the barrel of the gun, near the muzzle, communicated
with a small cylinder in which was a
spring-pressed piston. The gases pursuing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
bullet out of the barrel would find this tiny hole and,
entering it, push back the piston. The pressure
against the piston would be only a small fraction of
that exerted against the bullet and would last for
only the briefest part of a second, from the time the
bullet uncovered the hole to the time it emerged from
the barrel and liberated the gases, but this minute
portion of the energy of the powder was sufficient
to actuate the mechanism which performed all the
operations necessary to reload and fire the gun.</p>

<h3>COOLING THE GUN BARREL</h3>

<p>The advantage of these machine guns over Gatling’s
lay not only in the saving of human labor, but
in the fact that a single barrel was employed in place
of ten, thereby greatly reducing the weight of the
gun. But a serious handicap was encountered in
the heat developed by the burning powder. Dr.
Gatling, by using ten barrels, could let nine be cooling
while the tenth was discharging, but even he
found it necessary to place a water jacket about half
the length of the barrels. In the Maxim machine
gun a large water jacket enveloped the whole length
of the barrel and when the gun was firing continuously
at a moderate rate the 7½ pints of water
contained in the water jacket would come to a boil
inside of a minute and a half, and thereafter more
than a pint would be evaporated each minute of firing,
or about a pint and a half per thousand rounds.
The necessity of using water-cooling added considerably
to the weight of the gun and made it
occupy in the service an intermediate place between
the shoulder rifle and the big gun.</p>

<p>Another method of cooling was to use a barrel
with a large outer diameter and depend upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
radiation of heat from the outer surface to prevent
overheating. This was later improved by putting
flanges on the outer surface of the barrel, so as to
increase the radiating surface, in the same way that
the cylinders of a motorcycle are kept cool. The
barrel was made easily detachable and a spare one
provided, so that as soon as the barrel grew excessively
hot it could be removed and replaced with
a cool barrel. The fault of overheating is not that it
might explode the cartridge prematurely but that
the bore will be enlarged by heat expansion so that
the bullets will not take the rifling and will come
out of the barrel as if from a smooth-bore gun. In
a test of a Hotchkiss machine gun which was fired
continuously the expansion was sufficient at the end
of four minutes to make the course of the bullets
very uncertain and in seven minutes the bullets,
emerging without any spin, tumbled over and over
and failed to carry more than three hundred yards.</p>

<h3>A GUN THAT FANS ITSELF</h3>

<p>The next marked step in the development of the
machine gun was to make it fan itself and thus keep
its barrel cool. Col. I. N. Lewis designed a gun
operated by gas pressure somewhat on the principle
of the Colt gun and around the barrel he fitted sixteen
deep flanges or fins of aluminum that ran
lengthwise of the gun. Around these fins he fitted
a casing, thus forming 16 long narrow chambers
about the barrel. The casing was open at the breech
end, but at the outer end was contracted into a narrow
mouthpiece that extended beyond the muzzle.
The mouthpiece was so formed that as the bullets
passed through it they sucked air through the chambers,
thereby cooling the gun. The air travels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
through the casing at the rate of about seventy miles
per hour.</p>

<p>This design permitted Col. Lewis to build a very
light gun. Its total weight was but 25½ pounds
and it could be handled by a single man if the muzzle
was supported on some sort of a rest. It represented
a marked step toward a shoulder machine
gun which would increase enormously the efficiency
of infantry equipped with this weapon. The difference
between rifle fire and machine-gun fire has
been likened to the difference between trying to hit
a tin can with a stone and with a stream of water
from a hose. In the latter case the hose may be
raised or lowered to correct the course of the stream
and bring it to bear on the target. In the same way
by watching the effect of the machine-gun bullets
the leaden stream may be corrected to bring it directly
upon the target. The advantages of a weapon
such as this, which may be fired from the shoulder
or from the hip, are perfectly obvious.</p>

<p>As the war was nearing its end John M. Browning
produced two machine guns, one a water-cooled
heavy model fired from a stand. The total weight
of this gun was 34½ pounds and with the water
jacket empty it weighed but 22½ pounds. It was
operated by the recoil of the gun, but the mechanism
was greatly simplified and there were but few parts.
These could be taken apart and replaced with new
ones in a minimum of time in case of breakage. The
other gun was a shoulder rifle weighing only 16
pounds, which carried a clip of twenty cartridges.
These could be fired singly or in rapid succession
in the space of two and a half seconds. Only
a second was required to replace the empty clip with
a filled one. No special cooling apparatus was provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
because it was not likely that a shoulder rifle
would be fired long enough at a time to become excessively
heated.</p>

<h3>POCKET-SIZED MACHINE GUN</h3>

<p>The latest development in machine guns is a
pocket edition weapon&mdash;a firearm weighing only 7
pounds and measuring but 22 inches over all. This
little gun which is too small to be classed as a rifle
and yet rather large for a pistol, has two grips
so that it may be fired from the waist line, and it
may be fitted with a gun butt so that it may be fired
from the shoulder. It operates at the astounding
rate of 1,500 shots per minute or three times the
speed of the average machine gun. The cartridges
are fed either from a box magazine containing 20
rounds or from a drum-shaped magazine loaded with
50 to 100 cartridges. The operating mechanism of
this gun is entirely different from anything produced
heretofore and depends upon a discovery made
by Commander Blish of the United States Navy.
He found that a wedge of a certain angle will hold
a breechblock closed against the pressure of an exploding
cartridge while the pressure is high, but
will slide when the pressure falls. Apparently at
first the adhesion due to friction is too great to permit
the wedge to move, but the adhesion falls off
more rapidly than the pressure does and a point is
reached at which the wedge yields to the pressure.
In the “submachine” gun, as the new weapon is
called, the barrel (or rather an extension of the
barrel) and the receiver, in which the operating
mechanism is contained, are locked together by a
wedge. The wedge slides in slots set at an angle of
80 degrees with the axis of the barrel. When a cartridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
is fired the wedge remains fast while the
bullet is traveling through the bore, but when
it emerges and the pressure of the gases falls
off the wedge slides, unlocking the breech mechanism.
The gun is remarkable for its simplicity
and the fewness of its parts. It has been
adopted by the Police Department of New York City.</p>

<h3>ARTILLERY VS. ARMOR</h3>

<p>As has been stated above, gunpowder was first
introduced in warfare not for the purpose of destroying
men, but for smashing city walls and fortifications,
so that infantry could pour through the
breeches made by the heavy stone or iron projectiles.
As artillery grew more powerful and the aim
more accurate walls of masonry gave way to earthworks
and to masses of concrete and armored steel.
However the World War demonstrated the impossibility
of building any fortifications above ground
that would stand up against modern high-powered
guns.</p>

<h3>GUNS, MORTARS, AND HOWITZERS</h3>

<p>In military parlance a “gun” is a long-barreled
piece that fires its projectiles with a flat trajectory,
that is, the projectile is fired at a low angle and describes
a long flat curve. A “mortar” is a short-ranged
weapon which fires at a high angle so as to
land its projectile over the walls of a fortification.
The barrel of the mortar was formerly very short
and had a smooth bore, but later the barrel was extended
and the bore rifled so as to give a greater
range, developing what is known as the “howitzer.”
The famous 42-centimeter gun with which the Germans
started the war was a howitzer which fired a
shell a yard and a half long weighing 2,108 pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
We have big guns to defend our coasts which fire a
shell 16 inches in diameter, which is half an inch
less than 42 centimeters, and the weight of the shell
is 2,400 pounds. But the startling thing about the
German big howitzers was that they were portable
and could be brought up to smash fixed defenses. As
the war proceeded enormous guns as well as howitzers
were set on railroad mounts and moved about
from time to time to avoid discovery by spying
aviators.</p>

<h3>THE 76-MILE GUN</h3>

<p>The 76-mile gun which bombarded Paris fired projectiles
of only 8.27-inch caliber. The projectile described
a wide curve which carried it about twenty-four
miles above the surface of the earth or about
3½ times as high as the greatest altitude ever
reached by man in an aeroplane. Had it pursued a
perfectly straight line from the forest of St. Gobain
to Paris its course would have carried it 3,750 feet
below the surface, because of the curvature of the
earth. The range of the projectile was very materially
increased by rising to such a great elevation because
of the extreme tenuity of the atmosphere. The
air resistance that a shell is obliged to overcome is
not generally appreciated. In the denser strata of the
lower atmosphere the resistance is very great, but
as a shell mounts to higher levels the air resistance
falls off considerably and at twenty miles it is practically
nonexistent.</p>

<p>It was not until the summer after the armistice
that details of this gun were disclosed. There were
seven of these powerful guns that participated in
the various bombardments. They wore out very
quickly under the terrific strain to which they were
subjected and were rebored to a diameter of 9.4<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
inches. In the last bombardment a number of shells
of this size reached Paris. The guns were fired at
an angle of 55 degrees from the horizontal so as to
pass quickly through the denser layers of the air.
The shell left the muzzle of the gun with the velocity
of about 5,000 feet per second and arrived in Paris
about three minutes later with a velocity of about
half that amount. The enormous muzzle velocity
was obtained by using a very long gun so that the
powder could keep pushing the projectile for a comparatively
long time. The guns were built out of
worn-out 15-inch naval guns. These guns which
were 56 feet long were rebored, fitted with a heavy
tube and pieced out to a length of 118 feet. The last
20 feet of the bore was not rifled and served as a
guide to keep the shell in perfect axial alignment
when it emerged from the muzzle. A comparatively
slow powder was used so as not to put too severe a
strain on the gun at the breech, but gradually to
accelerate the shell in its travel through the bore.</p>

<p>Spectacular as was the performance of these huge
guns, they were of little military value. The slightest
variation in the powder would cause a wide variation
of range and they could not hope to hit a target smaller
than a large city. All seven guns fired a total of
303 shells in 44 days of bombardment, only 183 of
which fell within the city. They killed 256 persons
and wounded 620. Far more damage at far less expense
could have been effected by dropping bombs
from aircraft.</p>

<h3>A 121-MILE GUN</h3>

<p>Just as a problem in ordnance, American officers
designed a gun 225 feet long which would fire a
400-pound shell of 10-inch caliber. It was estimated
that with a charge of 1,440 pounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
powder the shell would leave the muzzle with a
velocity of 8,500 feet per second and, if fired at an
angle of 55 degrees, would have a range of 121
miles. The shell would rise to a height of 46 miles
above the earth and would make the 121 miles in
about 4 minutes. The gun was never built,
because its military value would in no way be commensurate
with its cost of construction and operation.
The purpose of the German long-range bombardment
was to produce a moral rather than a
military effect. The Germans hoped to intimidate
the French people by this spectacular performance,
and in this they failed completely.</p>

<h3>TIMED AND PERCUSSION SHELLS</h3>

<p>In modern warfare large guns are used either to
rain a storm of death upon infantry or to destroy
their defensive works. In earlier days the effectiveness
of gunfire against a charging enemy was
increased by the use of grapeshot. A cannon
was thus converted into a gigantic shotgun. But
although a wide dispersion of projectiles was obtained
the range was very limited. This handicap
was then overcome by having the gun fire another
gun which would discharge when it had reached the
enemy’s lines. In other words, the grapeshot or
leaden balls were packed into a shell which was
fired like a solid projectile, and this exploded when
it struck the target, scattering death broadcast. An
improvement on this was the timed shell, which
would explode while still in the air and scatter its
rain of lead over a wide area. The time fuse of a
shrapnel shell must be very delicately adjusted to
explode at the desired instant. A train of powder
is used which may be short-circuited to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
exact length required for any given distance. The
powder is ignited by a cap which is exploded by
concussion when the gun is fired. The fuse then
burns until it reaches the main charge of the shell.
This explodes, bursting the shell open and scattering
shell fragments as well as the scores of lead
balls with which the shell is packed. Should the
fuse fail, a detonating pin is provided which will
explode the shell when it reaches the ground.
Where the object is to destroy defensive works the
shell is charged with a high explosive which is detonated
not by a time fuse, but by concussion when
the shell strikes its target.</p>

<p>The war brought forth many new types of projectiles:
shells loaded with lethal gases; shells
which left a trail of smoke whereby their course
could be followed when fired at aircraft; shells that
illuminated the battlefield at night, etc. The searchlight
shells carried a number of “candles,” each furnished
with a little parachute so that when the shell
exploded the burning candles would settle slowly to
the ground, all the while casting a brilliant light on
operations below.</p>

<h3>AERIAL BOMBS</h3>

<p>Obviously, hurling projectiles from the air is a
much simpler matter than projecting them from
the ground. No propellant is required to carry
them to the target and no rifling is necessary to
keep them head-on in the direction of flight. They
are pulled instead of being pushed and can easily
be kept in their course by means of rudder planes.
But hitting a target from an aeroplane is like hitting
a swiftly moving object from the ground. The target
is seemingly flying past the aeroplane and in
calculating where the aerial bomb will strike the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
speed of the plane through the air and its height
above the ground must all be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Naval warfare is a fight of fort against fort and
consequently the high explosive projectile is the
principal one used. The shells must be able to penetrate
heavy steel armor and explode within the hull
of the vessel. In addition to these we have the
torpedoes fired by destroyers and submarines which
explode an enormous quantity of high explosive
against the hull of the vessel. No attempt is made
to penetrate the skin of the vessel, but the explosive,
tamped by a considerable depth of water, delivers
a very heavy crushing blow against the side of
the hull.</p>

<h3>AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF SUBMARINE TORPEDOES</h3>

<p>It is wrong to speak of firing a torpedo. A torpedo
is really an automatic, self-propelled, submarine
boat. All that the destroyer or submarine
does is to set the steering gear in this little boat and
then launch it at the enemy with a blast of air that
ejects it from the torpedo tube. Most of the body
of the torpedo is filled with compressed air which
drives a small air motor coupled to a pair of propellers.
These propellers run in opposite directions
so as to balance each other and they drive the torpedo
through the water at a speed of about forty
miles per hour. The speed falls off gradually as the
air supply is exhausted.</p>

<p>To hold the torpedo on its course horizontal and
vertical rudders are employed. The vertical rudder
is controlled by a gyroscope which turns it this
way or that according as the torpedo tends to veer
off its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of a torpedo lies in its concealment.
Were it to travel on the surface the vessel against
which it was directed might be able to avoid it;
furthermore the action of the waves would tend to
disturb the gyroscopic steering mechanism and the
torpedo would pursue an erratic course. For this
reason it must travel under water at a depth
sufficient to avoid surface disturbances. There is
also a distinct advantage in having a good cover of
water over the torpedo when it strikes its target
because the force of the explosion, although felt
in all directions, is mainly expended along the line
of the least resistance. If the depth of water over
the torpedo is slight, most of the force will be expended
upward and only a comparatively small part
will act against the hull of the vessel. It was the
practice of the Germans to set their torpedoes for
a depth of about ten feet.</p>

<p>To hold a torpedo at a fixed depth a very delicate
hydrostatic valve is employed which operates the
diving rudders. The valve is set for a certain depth
or weight of water. If the torpedo goes below this
depth, the weight of the water bearing on this valve
presses it down and thereby tilts the diving rudders
until the torpedo comes back to the required depth.
If it rises above the depth for which it is set, the
valve feels the reduction of water pressure and tilts
the rudders in the opposite direction to correct the
deviation from the predetermined line of travel.
Once the valve has been set the torpedo takes care
of itself automatically. It may be discharged from
any depth or be dropped from torpedo tubes on the
deck of a ship and after a few undulations it will
find its depth and hold it as long as it keeps
running.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Torpedoes have actually been discharged from
aeroplanes and it is possible that in the next great
war swiftly flying aeroplanes may actually bring
death and destruction to powerful dreadnoughts.
In fact winged destroyers and battle cruisers of
the air may render obsolete all our modern fighting
machines.</p>

<p>As we have already observed, it was war that first
aroused the inventive instincts in man. Fortunately
this instinct was not confined to destructive devices
and engines, and the mechanical conquest of the
earth, although it continues to derive much benefit
from the stimulus of war, may well afford to break
off relations with so grim and horrible a partner
and proceed to develop under the stimulus of its
own successes.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="pch">SUMMARY OF MECHANICAL PROGRESS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE REAL beginning of the present age of machinery
dates from Watt’s invention of the double-acting
steam engine which was patented in 1782. Prior
to that date the steam engine was used merely for
pumping water, but now in its new form it was
adapted for use in driving industrial machinery.
But, as we have shown in another chapter, it was
not until John Wilkinson invented his boring machine
in 1774 that it was possible to bore the cylinders
that Watt used in his engine.</p>

<p>In the field of machine tools there were several
notable inventions. Henry Maudslay invented the
slide rest for lathes and later in 1797 the screwcutting
lathe. Joseph Bramah invented the hydraulic
press and Maudslay furnished the cup
leather packing that made it a success. Woodworking
machinery, and particularly mortising machines
for making pulley blocks, were invented by
Samuel Bentham and patented in 1791 and 1793.</p>

<p>In the textile industry we find the spinning jenny
invented by Hargreaves in 1770, Richard Arkwright’s
roll-drawing spinning machine invented
in 1769 and 1775, and Crompton’s mule spinner invented
between 1774 and 1779, but never patented.
In addition to this there was the invention of the
cotton gin in 1794 by our own Eli Whitney and Dr.
Cartwright’s series of patents on the power-driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
loom granted between 1785 and 1788. In 1799 Louis
Roberts invented a machine that would make a continuous
web of paper. The machine was developed
in England by the Fourdrinier Brothers and has
ever since borne their name.</p>

<h3>1801-1810</h3>

<p>Just before the Nineteenth Century dawned the
patents on Watt’s steam engine expired and the invention
became public property.</p>

<p>Trevithic applied steam power to the propulsion
of a coach in 1801. This was the forerunner of the
automobile and it led to the invention of the first
steam railway and locomotive three years later.
Steam was also applied to the propulsion of boats in
this decade and reached the practical stage when
Fulton built the Clermont in 1807. The first application
of steam to the driving of a loom is accredited
to William Horrocks in 1803. Jacquard’s loom attachment
for producing various patterns was invented
in 1801. The first knitting machine in which
the latch needle was used was patented in France in
1806 by Jeandeau.</p>

<p>Among the machine-tool developments the most
important were Bramah’s invention of the planer
in 1802 and Brunel’s mortising machine in 1801. A
process of making malleable iron castings was invented
by Lucas in 1804. The percussion lock for
guns was invented by Forsyth in 1807.</p>

<h3>1811-1820</h3>

<p>The second decade saw a much wider application
of steam and considerable development in locomotives.
Hedley’s “Puffing Billy” was built in 1813,
and Stephenson’s first locomotive in 1814.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same year Fulton built the first steam war
vessel and five years later the Atlantic was crossed
for the first time by a steamer, the Savannah.
The rotary steam printing press belongs to this
decade.</p>

<p>The circular knitting machine was invented by
Brunel in 1816. About 1818 Eli Whitney invented
the milling machine, and in 1819 Blanchard invented
his “gun-stocking” lathe with which irregular forms
could be turned out. The breech-loading musket
was patented in this country by Thornton and Hall
in 1811.</p>

<h3>1821-1830</h3>

<p>In this decade we find the conversion of electricity
into mechanical motion and many other important
electrical developments, which, however, are omitted
from this list as we are confining ourselves to
mechanical inventions. There were marked developments
in steam railroads. Stephenson built the
“Rocket” which won prizes on the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, and the first locomotive was
imported into this country in 1829. The tubular
locomotive boiler was invented by Seguin in 1828
and Ericsson’s portable steam fire engine was built
in 1830. In the previous year an important improvement
in spinning mules was made when John
Thorpe invented the ring frame.</p>

<h3>1831-1840</h3>

<p>Important railroad developments mark the opening
of this decade. The famous locomotive “John
Bull” was imported from England in 1831 to operate
on the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The following
year saw the first American-built locomotive,
“Old Ironsides,” which was built at Philadelphia by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Stephenson’s link
motion, also claimed by W. T. James, was invented in
1832.</p>

<p>However, the most important development of the
decade was the invention of the reaper. Hussey’s
patent was obtained in 1833 and McCormick’s the
following year.</p>

<p>Colt’s revolver (1836); Perkin’s portable ice machine
(1834); Anthony’s (1831), Tolle’s (1834),
and Burden’s (1835) developments in machines for
making horseshoes; and Isaac Babbit’s antifriction-bearing
metal are other notable developments.</p>

<h3>1841-1850</h3>

<p>It was in 1841 that F. E. Sickels invented the drop
cut-off valve gear, and the Corliss valve gear was
patented in 1849 and 1851. Nasmyth’s steam hammer
was invented in 1842.</p>

<p>Hoe’s revolving printing press was invented in
1845. The next year Sloan patented the gimlet-pointed
screw. In 1847 Savage invented the time
lock, and in 1849 Hibbert patented the latch needle
for knitting machines. American machine-made
watches appeared in 1850. However, the most important
invention of the decade was Howe’s sewing
machine in 1845.</p>

<h3>1851-1860</h3>

<p>The year 1851 saw an important improvement in
the harvester when Seymour invented his self-raker,
also an advance in firearms when Maynard
invented the breech-loading rifle. Three years later
Smith &amp; Wesson came forth with their magazine
rifle which was the forerunner of the “Winchester.”
In that year Wilson invented the four-motion feed
for sewing machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most notable inventions of the decade
was Bessemer’s converter for producing steel
(1855), and the following year Siemens produced
the regenerative furnace.</p>

<p>Gifford’s injector (1858) marked a most important
advance in steam engineering. The hand-turned
turret for lathes was invented by Stephen
Fitch about 1853, and the automatically revolving
turret was brought out in 1855.</p>

<p>Other inventions of the decade were Herman’s
diamond drill (1854), Ericsson’s air engine (1855),
the pedal-operated bicycle by Ernest Michaux
(1855), use of wood pulp in the manufacture of
paper by Voelter (1858), and the ammonia absorption
ice machine invented by Carré.</p>

<h3>1861-1870</h3>

<p>The Civil War directed attention of inventors to
military and naval improvements. Dr. Gatling invented
his machine gun in 1862, the same year that
Ericsson built the “Monitor.” It is interesting to
note that the revolving turret was patented in that
year by Theodore R. Timby. Dynamite was invented
in 1867, and the Whitehead torpedo in the
same year. Barbed wire was invented in 1861. The
same year saw the first passenger elevator invented
by Otis; the shoe-sewing machine invented by
McKay, and Col. Green’s invention of the drive
well, which was brought about by the necessity of
supplying his troops with water.</p>

<p>The pneumatic rock drill was invented by Burleigh
in 1866, and Westinghouse invented the air
brake in 1869. The latter, with Sholes’s invention
of the typewriter in the previous year, were undoubtedly
the most notable inventions of the decade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1865 the cylindrical grinder marked a decided
forward step in machine tools.</p>

<h3>1871-1880</h3>

<p>This decade was marked by great activity, particularly
in the field of electricity. While we are
confining ourselves to mechanical inventions we
cannot but mention Bell’s telephone (1876), Edison’s
carbon filament lamp (1878), and Berliner’s
transmitter and Edison’s carbon microphone which
belong to the decade, although their patents were
not issued until 1891 and 1892 respectively.</p>

<p>The web printing press was invented by Hoe in
1871. Ingersoll’s compressed air rock drill appeared
in the same year. A marked improvement in the
Westinghouse air brake was patented in 1872, and
the automatic car coupler appeared in 1873. The
positive motion loom was invented by Lyall in 1872.</p>

<p>The harvester was improved by Gorham’s twine
binder in 1874, and in the same year a machine for
making barbed wire was produced.</p>

<p>The Centennial year saw an important development
in milling processes when the roller mill was
introduced to take the place of the time-honored
millstones. The middlings purifier was invented
by George T. Smith in 1875. The hydraulic dredge
was invented in 1876, also the universal grinder,
and a machine for making cigarettes.</p>

<p>Edison’s invention of the phonograph and Otto’s
invention of the gas engine give prominence to
the year 1877 and the Remington typewriter to the
year 1878.</p>

<h3>1881-1890</h3>

<p>The inventions of most far-reaching importance
in this decade were Mergenthaler’s linotype machine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
which was invented in 1884 and further
developed into a practical machine in 1890; Gottlieb
Daimler’s invention of the automobile in 1883,
and J. B. Dunlop’s invention of the pneumatic
tire in 1890.</p>

<p>Berliner in 1887 invented the flat-disk talking
machine known as the “Gramophone.” The snapshot
“Kodak” camera appeared in 1888. In this
year De Laval invented his steam turbine, while
Harvey invented his process for annealing armor
plate.</p>

<p>The following year nickel steel was invented. In
1883 Sir Hiram Maxim invented the machine gun.
Hugo Bilgram’s generating system of gear cutting
was invented in 1881.</p>

<p>A less prominent, though very important, invention
of the same year was the buttonhole machine
patented by Reece.</p>

<p>Incidentally this decade saw the completion of the
Brooklyn Suspension Bridge in 1883, and the Great
Forth Bridge in 1890.</p>

<h3>1891-1900</h3>

<p>The last decade of the Nineteenth Century gave
us Parson’s steam turbine (1891) and Curtis’s steam
turbine (1896); also Rudolf Diesel’s heavy-oil engine.</p>

<p>Langley’s model for a motor-driven airplane was
built in 1896 and actually flew. Santos-Dumont
made his first ascension in a dirigible in 1898, and
Count Friedrich von Zeppelin built his first rigid
dirigible in 1900.</p>

<p>J. B. Holland built a steam-driven submarine, and
Simon Lake constructed the first submarine to be
driven by an internal combustion engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>This decade was largely devoted to the development
of the automobile, which gradually evolved into
a truly commercial machine. About 1900, Benjamin
Holt invented the “caterpillar” tractor. The decade
also saw the invention of the Lanston “monotype,”
and Henry Wise Wood’s “autoplate” machine
which revolutionized stereotyping.</p>

<p>In 1899 William Draper brought out a loom with
an automatic shuttle-changing mechanism. Hulett
invented the automatic ore unloader in 1898. Improvements
were also made in automatic machine
tools. J. E. Gleason improved the Bilgram gear cutter
in 1898, and at the close of the century Taylor
and White brought out their high-speed cutting tools
which revolutionized machine tools.</p>

<p>The decade was also remarkable for the invention
of X-rays, wireless telegraphy, and certain chemical
processes, none of which really belong in this
summary.</p>

<h3>1901-1910</h3>

<p>In this decade the automobile reached a marvelous
state of perfection and a tremendous industry was
built up which had a marked influence on the development
of machine tools and the production of
iron and steel. James A. Gailey invented a dryblast
process for steel production, getting rid of the
moisture in air by subjecting it to a freezing process.
Fellow’s gear-cutting machine was perfected and
Bullard brought out the vertical turret lathe. There
were important developments of the steam turbine.</p>

<p>There is one invention that makes this decade
stand out from among all others. On December
17, 1903, the Wright brothers made a successful
flight in a biplane driven by a gasoline engine,
and opened up a new world for conquest. Man took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
to wings and the dream of ages was realized. During
the decade rapid progress was made in developing
the flying machine. The invention of the monoplane
soon followed.</p>

<p>It was in this decade that the gyroscope emerged
from the laboratory and toy shop and began to be
applied to practical uses. Schlick utilized the gyroscope
to prevent ships from rolling. The gyrocompass
was invented and reached a commercial
stage in 1910.</p>

<h3>1911-1920</h3>

<p>It is difficult to pick out the most important inventions
of this decade because sufficient time has
not elapsed to determine which are most deserving
of mention. The Great World War stimulated invention
in all civilized lands. Aeronautics developed
faster in the five years of war than it could in
twenty-five years of peace. Of course, engines of
war developed to a remarkable degree. Among the
lighter pieces we saw the development of the Lewis
gun, and then the Browning gun. The most important
invention was the tank. Many advances
should be classed as remarkable developments rather
than basically new inventions. The war of and
against the submarine brought forth many ingenious
devices.</p>

<p>Of the peace-time inventions, the most remarkable
is the optophone, the instrument which enables the
blind to read ordinary printed matter.</p>

<p class="p2">And thus the march of progress continues unchecked.
We are tempted to give our imaginations
free play and forecast the developments that the
future holds in store for us, but unfortunately we
cannot claim any prophetic instinct or inspiration.</p>
